I&#8217;m sitting in the only pub on the island, abusing the free internet and staring out of the window at the gorgeousness. This place rocks, it&#8217;s so quiet and away from everything. I&#8217;ve been here since thursday, and I&#8217;m actually sad to be leaving tomorrow.
  
I haven&#8217;t done much in the way of tramping or walking, but I have realised the extreme need I have of a pair of halfway decent hiking boots, as I&#8217;m just starting to get into going for nice long walks. (long, not too long).
  
A fun night was had last night with a pile of semi-drunken to drunken kiwi men aged from 16 to 56. Pretty much all good. I left when they started talking about having a fight, but I think they were mostly talk anyway.
  
OK, the free internet needs to be shared, so time to sign off.
  
I&#8217;ve got no coverage on my phone here, so I&#8217;ll be glad to get back to the mainland for that reason, and get back to the tourist trail&#8230; Riverton, Te Anau, Milford Sound and Queenstown.
  
On tractorboy&#8217;s advice I&#8217;m considering just doing some of the fun things in queenstown and then heading up to Wanaka. Will keep y&#8217;all posted.
  
Blue Cod is YUM. I am a BUM. With a pain in my TUM. o yeah!
