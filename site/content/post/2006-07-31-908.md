  * Went on a three-pub pub crawl without a single drop of alchohol (in about an hour total).
  * Curled up in a giggling ball on the floor of my kitchen, chewing two slices of toast as fast as I could while paul tried to take them out of my mouth with a spoon. 
  * Read about sailing the seven seas and wanted to really badly.
  * Cleaned my house, LOTS.
  * Put on a successful gig (huzzah and thanks)
  * Saw a sign in Beneton&#8217;s window that said &#8220;All Ladies €20 or Less&#8221;
  * Scared many many people with my astoundingly good Shakira impressing.
  * Got giddy with the Jeanius and hung out with the Anna.
  * Couldn&#8217;t find my dog.
