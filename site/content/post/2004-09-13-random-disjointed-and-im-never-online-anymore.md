ah. i need to update this more. my problem is that _I got up at 2 pm, i went to work, i came home, i went to globe bar, i went to bed,_ isn&#8217;t actually that interesting. I worked every single day this week. and I only got to sit in the park once. I&#8217;ll try to get up at a better time tomorrow.
  
The only person I&#8217;ve written to since I got here is my gran, and she&#8217;s my priority, since most of the rest of you can walk and talk and therefore aren&#8217;t quite as bored every day. But I&#8217;m going to try!
  
Oh, and from next week i&#8217;ll only be paying half price for my accommodation. Yay! cos i&#8217;ll be doing 15 hours work to get every second week at work free. This is good!
  
I have been proposed to three or four times in the last 2 weeks. that&#8217;s kind of a lot actually. I&#8217;m kind of half thinking of taking one or two of them up on it. I may actually get kiwi residency after all!
  
oh, and if anyone ever suggests Ice Bowling to you, don&#8217;t do it. Evonne, one of my bestest mates here, was playing it on friday and now has a fractured foot. And if you do decide to do it, DON&#8217;T sign a disclaimer! Otherwise you&#8217;ll have to pay for the medical bills!
