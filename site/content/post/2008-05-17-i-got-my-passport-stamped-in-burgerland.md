Last night, at a lovely barbeque at Dave and Joan&#8217;s to celebrate Mister Dave&#8217;s birthday, I put Hellman&#8217;s Burger Sauce on my burger for the first time. I didn&#8217;t know that time machine transporters came in burger sauce flavour, but they sure as hell do, because when I opened my eyes after that first bite, I was sitting on a green leatherette couch with mirrors on the walls in Burgerland on William Street.
  
Now, those were the days. Before McDonalds and Supermac&#8217;s and Eddie Rockets and Burgerking and (god forbid) KFC reared their ugly heads in our small city, the ultimate in treats for this Small Girl was to be taken to Burgerland for a kiddy meal and a milkshake. My mum&#8217;s was a Club Burger in Kranks, but I always used to be a little scared of it there after my neighbour got a brick to the side of the head there (after which, the bricker looked at him, said &#8220;oh, sorry. thought you were someone else&#8221;, and wandered off.)
  
But anyway, Burgerland&#8230; I only got back from there when someone shoved some hummus in my mouth to revive me. And I&#8217;m definitely bringing some Hellman&#8217;s Burger Sauce to barbeques with me in future!
