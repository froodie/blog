I saw this poem today, made the day a little brighter!

<span lang="EN-IE"></p> 

<p>
  <em>Ah, Juliet, tis the sun!</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>Never thought we&#8217;d see another one.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>We feigned our death this day.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>We fooled them all</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>And ran away.</em>
</p>
