It&#8217;s official. I&#8217;m finally a Dubliner (or whatever it is that real Dublin people call blow-ins from down the country). I&#8217;ve handed back the keys to my lovely apartment in Limerick and torn up as many Limerick roots as I can, or want to (<a href="http://www.ancor.ie" target="_blank">Ancór</a> and <a href="http://www.limerickrollergirls.com" target="_blank">Limerick Roller Girls</a> 4 LYFE!). I now live in The Smoke that is bigger than the other Smokes on this tiny island. I am cohabiting with Mr. Knows-I&#8217;m-Right and have even ventured to Portmarnock for a walk on the beach.

Now that the Tree of My Life has been prised from the fertile soil of the Mid-West, it&#8217;s time to put down new roots in Dublin. Finding a new doctor, dentist, hairdresser and Thai takeaway is one thing, but getting settled in a place is about a lot more than practicalities. Working out when&#8217;s good to meet my bestie for post-work drinks, getting into the habit of going to talks and tweetups, finding a new craft group to intermittently attend and working up the courage to join Dublin Roller Girls are all little obstacles in themselves.

I didn&#8217;t leave the house once this weekend, so I&#8217;ve set myself the challenge of doing at least one sociable and one educational (outside of the coursework hanging over my head) thing per week.

Last week&#8217;s educational thing was the <a href="http://www.defuse.ixd.ie/" target="_blank">Defuse IXDA</a> talks in the Sugar Club. Attendees were subjected to eleven Ignite-style quick talks on topics ranging from
  
_Designing For the Future Old: Complexity and Ethnography_ to _How content strategy can help you get a date. _The venue suited the informal format, and the free bottles of Bavaria were also much appreciated. What I took from the event was the idea of awareness &#8211; from being aware of how you are perceived by those around you, to awareness of the invisible infrastructures that make our lives easier. Definitely well-worth attending &#8211; fun and thought-provoking!

My sociable thing was visiting friends with a new baby. Suffice to say, the baby has a CROCHETED VIKING HAT!
