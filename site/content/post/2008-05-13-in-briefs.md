&#8230;because it&#8217;s too hot for pyjamas and I always worry that the house will go on fire and I&#8217;ll have to run out the door or jump out the window in the nip if I sleep naked and all the neighbours will snicker at my ladybits. 

But anyway&#8230;

I do miss writing, so I might come back.

And. I joined a choir, and a book club, and am getting urges to find myself a wee place to live. The house I live in smells of feet. I am as awful as ever for keeping in contact with people, and realising more than ever that it&#8217;s going to serve me ill in the future.

Anyone want to go halves on a houseboat?
