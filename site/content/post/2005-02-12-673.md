Today Dunedin is rain and bagpipes and soggy trouser legs and no breakfast yet, and talking to my mum and dad for ages on the phone for the first time in what seems like a million years! It was unbelieveably good to talk to them and they let me witter on for ages and actually gave me the gossip from home, which was cool. Now I&#8217;m definitely in the mood for fried eggs for breakfast&#8230; to the shop with me, for Greasy Breakfast Action&#8230; Booyah!
  
I&#8217;ve decided to leave dunedin tomorrow. So there. Or maybe the day after. I might go out tonight&#8230; Graaaah I am tired like zombie!
