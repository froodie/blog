Colmmacc is really as good at cropping photos as he is at taking them. We were driving around Galway at the weekend, and I was snapping away as he drove. He&#8217;s put some of my snaps up on his flickr, and I&#8217;m surprised at how well some of them turned out. Maybe I should buy a \*cough\* SLR \*cough\*
