You know those montages in silly Hollywood movies where one character lets themselves go completely and sits around watching daytime tv and eating cereal and wearing pyjamas/tracksuits all day with messy hair and an ever-expanding waistline? That&#8217;s me. For the past four and a half months, since my contract wasn&#8217;t renewed at the place were I worked and loved it, I&#8217;ve been a Hollywood stereotype. And yes, I&#8217;m listening to Rachmaninov&#8217;s second piano concerto at the moment too. And looking off into space while I try to figure out why I haven&#8217;t done a single thing on my to-do list for the day.

    That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m not so far gone that I didn&#8217;t have a list, but it&#8217;s a list that gets longer and longer, as my finger gets longer and longer. I&#8217;ve put off so much that normality now lives over a mountain of unfinished, undealt-with, unappetising STUFF. &nbsp;Dentists, doctors, pensions, driving licences. Things that would only take a moment to actually organise. And the overhanging imperative that never really goes away either &#8211; GET A JOB.

    I got depressed, you see. It had been looming all summer, but&nbsp;September hit, and my hopeful assertions that I&#8217;d have a chance to do all the things I&#8217;d been meaning to, and maybe travel, but be back at work before Christmas&#8230; they all fell by the wayside as listlessly checking the internet for someone responding to my dwindling posts/messages and staying awake well into the night and asleep well into the day took over.

    I decided&nbsp;in December that I&#8217;d had enough. I went to the doctor and got myself some anti-depressants. Feeling like I was doing the right thing buoyed me up and carried me over the festive season, but &nbsp;now that January is getting ready to move into February, I realise that I&#8217;ve slipped again. The insomnia that is part legacy of my depression, part side-effect of the anti-depressants is getting worse, and all of my good intentions vanish again each day as I try to grab some kind of sleep, that ends up beginning when most people get up, and lasting until lunchtime.

    It&#8217;s getting dark now. I feel like writing these words has accomplished something, but I&#8217;m really just kidding myself, and putting off the climb to normality yet again. But how do you start that climb when you can&#8217;t rest up and prepare? Is it just setting myself up for failure yet again?

    I&#8217;m going to tick off one thing on my list today that is a one-off must-do task. Then try one tomorrow as well. And I&#8217;m going to try to get some sleep. We&#8217;ll see what happens after that.
