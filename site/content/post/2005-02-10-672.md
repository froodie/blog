I can&#8217;t quite seem to get a handle on Dunedin. I&#8217;m not sure why, but it sort of eludes me. Maybe it&#8217;s because most of the students aren&#8217;t here, and there are usually around 25,000 of them? I&#8217;m not sure, but I think I could possibly like this town, once I get the hang of it.
  
Granted, it took me a lot longer than four days to get the hang of Auckland, but this place is so much smaller.
  
Yesterday was a bit cheesy and touristy.. I went to the Cadbury factory to do a tour, which meant lots of free samples and wandering around in the heat and the smell of chocolate with a perky guide. That was a bit crap, the Speights brewery tour was much better, because at the end of the tour, the guide just told us to help ourselves. The glasses were small, but some of the speciality beers were good. I particularly liked the Pale Ale and the Porter. The Pilsener was also yum.
  
Today I&#8217;m going to the art gallery to see an exhibition about Tokyo Streetwear that [nerdjunkie][1]{.lj-user} pointed me at about a million years ago. It looked cool back then, so I&#8217;ll check it out now that it&#8217;s arrived in Dunedin ðŸ™‚ Also will go second-hand bookshop browsing, provided I can actually find one, and I&#8217;ll also check out the Botanic Gardens. I&#8217;m missing the Gardens in Christchurch lots!
