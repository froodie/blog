<div id="fb-root">

On a day like today, it&#8217;s hard to be a misanthropist&#8230;
  
I must be about to die or something, i can&#8217;t seriously be this happy and not have something terrible happen (i&#8217;m touching wood as i type, i swear).
  
Aside from it being a beautiful day, and one of my classes being cancelled, and going guitar shopping with the firstyearcompsysboys (who are in third year), and playing with guitars and cymbals and getting a crappy capo for nearly half price, and talking about radio things, and sucking coffee through a twix, and buying my german novel and feeling accomplished, and still being happy about the band stuff, Steve from rest signed my guestbook and said many lovely things, and fielded a vague idea, which, if it happens, would be one of the coolest and nicest things ever to happen to me. I&#8217;ll say nothing further, but WOOOOOOHOOOOOO!
  
I feel like i&#8217;ve never been depressed in my life. Hope i can remember this feeling with a smile. It&#8217;s been a fantastic, wonderful, nothing particularly out of the ordinary day&#8230; except the email that was the icing on my week cake. Cake of Week?
