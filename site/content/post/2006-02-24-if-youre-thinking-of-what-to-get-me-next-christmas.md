&#8230; I&#8217;d quite like some informed opinions.

While I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to say that I&#8217;m ill-informed, or unopinionated, I don&#8217;t have the self-confidence in what I do think to stand up for it a lot of the time. There are so many different ways to be right, and so many grey areas that I sometimes find myself swayed by the arguments of others. This is a good thing in some ways, but I sometimes feel I lack the ability to back up my arguments and I&#8217;d quite like to be _docht, daingean_ about a few more things.

In other news, I&#8217;m going out to _Baile na hAbhann_ tomorrow morning to play in the studios at [TG4][1]. Monday I&#8217;m interviewing Michael D. Higgins and Iggy, the university president. Yesterday I gave my first ever workshop, on Radio Presenting in Irish (to which one person showed up), filled in for Kev on his radio show and recorded a Cumann Drámaíochta (drama society) play. Busy times, then.
