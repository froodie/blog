Well, it looks like I’m more or less recovered from Electric Picnic. Just waiting for the unexplained bruises to fade, and the various aches and pains to subside. Fantastic weekend though, wasn’t it?</span></span></span>

In work-a-day news, it’s my last week… just two more days left after today… but the word on the street is that I’m going to be doing one full day a week here anyway, probably even more than that. It does mean that I’ll have to be at work at 6am every Monday, but hey that one day a week is money. I’ll probably have a few more hours a week doing cover and phones and tech op and things (hopefully) so I’ll definitely be keeping my oar in til I hopefully get new contract.</span>
