from being a spending all my money, going out 4/5 nights a week, eating out type of girl, I have morphed into a &#8216;works 3 jobs, saves lots and is VERY BORING&#8217; type of girl

I&#8217;ve been cleaning kitchens in the hostel i&#8217;m staying in for the past few days, it&#8217;s easy and i get every second week rent free, along with free laundry and internet, and I did an interview for a job today, and scored a job in GE Insurance! incoming customer service, which means STUPID PEOPLE, but that&#8217;s ok! Better than cold calling telesales any day of the week! I&#8217;m keeping the market research job so i don&#8217;t spend money evenings and weekends, and life is going to be pretty quiet for the next couple months. I&#8217;m happy though! Even if I am about to be deserted by my Irish Chicas. They&#8217;re both going home within two days of each other. At least noone is going to be pestering me to go to the Pub until 3 in the morning anymore. Not after tuesday night anyway!
  
I still have LegoBoy for hugs and chats though, so long as he&#8217;s not being a whore, so that&#8217;s ok!
