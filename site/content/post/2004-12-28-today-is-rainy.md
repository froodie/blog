I am up like a stunt kite.

With my new hair of DOOM. Except that it looks a lot like the last time I had new hair (highlighted and flipped over to the side a little), except shorter and blonder. Yay.

I went to the pub after all, and then went to the Maeve&#8217;s house and sat on her couch until 5am laughing and singing and listening to music and playing a little and watching Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps. A lot.
