Today I am : LONELY and CRANKY and IRRITATED and all manner of nastiness.

Stupid Housemate didn&#8217;t put the rubbish out last night, so we get to have a STINKY-ASS flat all week. Yowza woohoo.

I think I need to run around and hit things.

Will get a handle on things again soon. Promise.

**edit:** scratch that&#8230; the Couch Colony are coming over to play.??
