I haven&#8217;t time to catch my breath. I have hours of driving to do this evening, tons of people to see, thank and hug and I have to go see my grandmother for what may be the last time. (which I am trying not to think about, hence the flippancy of everything. she doesn&#8217;t need me crying on her.) And I still have managed to find the time to catch up on my f-list, post a few comments and make a new friend (hi [lokust][1]{.lj-user}). Oh, and I have to pack too.

Fluster fluster fuss fuss Oooo Internet &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.
