The whole shoe painting idea that I suggested for Sunday got shunted to one side as I became the chick in shining armour at work (yet again) and went to Dublin to stand in for the regular producer on one of my programmes. This meant I missed out on the Summer (yes, kids, the Irish summer was on Sunday) but I did get to meet on of the absolute legends of Irish television, Mr. Jimmy McGee. He&#8217;s awful lovely!

Choir&#8217;s been cancelled today, which is a good thing, because I&#8217;m practically delirious with hormones today, and I won&#8217;t be at rehearsal again til mid-June at this stage. I&#8217;m going to miss it so much. Anyone interested in trying a barbershop quartet to tide me over? I&#8217;ll sing whatever you like so long as I can sing!

Tomorrow, I was looking forward to going to Stitch&#8217;n&#8217;Bitch (That&#8217;s still going on in the Old Quarter of a Tuesday evening) and finishing off my soon-to-be-lovely bag in the company of some knittery fiends, but yet again work is ruining everything. This time I&#8217;m headed to Galway for some work in the vicinity of the Volvo Ocean Race. Hopefully I&#8217;ll at least be able to spend some quality time with Galway peoples ðŸ™‚

I was supposed to be going to a wedding this weekend too, but that&#8217;s also not happening. 

Seriously, kids&#8230; what&#8217;s going on?

I&#8217;m off to Barcelona for the weekend after next, and I&#8217;m dreading the thought that something&#8217;s going to happen to scupper those plans too. I&#8217;m deliberately leaving my Bank Holiday Weekend unplanned, so that nobody can ruin it!

That&#8217;s the plan anyway&#8230;
