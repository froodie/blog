I am in Galway for the weekend, getting all my stuff together to move it all down back home to Limerick. I&#8217;ve been down there for the past six weeks, and last week I started work in [lyric][1]. So far so lovely. It&#8217;s nice and relaxed, which it would have to be, with all the lovely classical music wafting around the building. The work is fine, and I know enough about classical music to be able to bluff it until I learn more. I&#8217;m also working on the world music show and the trad music show.
  
The funniest thing is that I&#8217;m on the breakfast shift, which means that one week I&#8217;ll be starting work at 8am, and the following week I&#8217;ll start at 6.30am. Anyone who&#8217;s actually met me will find that hilarious. As do I. But I&#8217;m liking the fact that I can sometimes finish at half past two or three o&#8217;clock. But yes. Good. Working. Excellent.

The skinny, bespectacled songsmith upon whom I have had a crush for the past few months slept on my couch last night. He is currently smitten with a girl that&#8217;s not me, and I&#8217;m doing my best to just cop myself on and stop being such a girly drip about the whole thing.

My life is being quite lovely at the moment, and I&#8217;m not doing too much to stop it continuing as such. Excellent!
