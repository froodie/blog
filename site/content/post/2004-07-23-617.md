My fixation with possessions will come to an end pretty quickly once I have to carry them all on my back. Who&#8217;da thunk that a few changes of clothes and a toothbrush would weigh so much? Well, slightly more than that, perhaps. I wish I could bring a laptop (but I don&#8217;t have one), a ballgown (just in case, even though I hate balls), a guitar (so that I could learn how to play it and do some busking) and the new set of kitchen knives my mum bought last week because I made her. (because mmmm)
  
I&#8217;ve been trying to convince her to buy good knives for years now,Â  but last week I managed to get her upstairs in Brown Thomas while the sale was on and after she&#8217;d been paid.
  
Even if I can only play with them for a little while longer, the feeling of joy they bring, even when I&#8217;m doing something unappetising like dicing chicken breasts, is sooo nice. So I&#8217;m going to have to settle down sometime, so that I can have a place to keep good kitchen knives. Travelling with sabatier knives hanging off your backpack might be frowned upon you see.
  
I&#8217;ve been feeling remarkably adored lately. Which is nice. You all may continue ðŸ˜€

But seriously. Thanks!

I know the BEST people!
