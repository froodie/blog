Good afternoon,

Yesterday I arrived in Dunedin, proceeded to get lost, (which is never a good idea with a backpack that&#8217;s too heavy), get found, went online to check my mail and update here, couldn&#8217;t check my mail cos none of the websites would open, managed to open LJ and typed up a major updatey post on getting drunk and misbehaving, leaving christchurch, lake tekapo and the unbelievable gorgeousness, oamaru and limestone and small-town-ness and penguins and tour buses, and weird nightmares about fountains and collapsing buildings, and tried to post it and it died, which was the computer&#8217;s fault, not mine&#8230; and i had to pay $4 for the privilege of NOT BEING ABLE TO CHECK MY MAIL and GETTING UPSET THAT MY UPDATE GOT EATEN. Funny enough, I was in a pissy-about-to-cry mood for the next while. Decided that on a hot day what I needed was a cooling chocolatey drink to seratonin me up and cool me down, but no! Starbucks only had mango and raspberry frappucinos.
  
Stomped around for another while and eventually cheered up due to caffeine and deftones music playing in Real Groovy. Went back to the backpackers I&#8217;m staying in and read a couple of chapters of Manufacturing Consent, which made me feel much better because of the awfulness of it all. The bigger picture made me realise that whiners are weiners, so I stopped whining.
  
I got organised enough today to post home some superfluities, transfer some money to my NZ account, DEMAND money from the people I&#8217;m pretty sure still owe it to me, and um, message random cute english boys on okcupid. hehe.
  
Now i&#8217;m going to run and get me something cold to drink. And probably pay another $4 for internet-ness&#8230; but at least this time around I actually got to do what I needed to do!
