I have spent by far the greater part of today in bed. It was my hostel&#8217;s staff party last night&#8230; lots of good Japanese food, sake, beer, champagne, shots and beer. And me being very drunk. Who is the boy with the green hat? I don&#8217;t know, but I had lots of fun all the same. Danced and flirted and tried to pick up boys and girls, and eventually succeeded in finding a boy who wanted to kiss me. And lost my glasses due to dancing too energetically and crawled around the dancefloor in papa jack&#8217;s and popped the lens out when I did find them, and promptly forgot all about it. Hence having no idea what The Boy in the Green Hat looks like. Although I do have a vague idea that he&#8217;s cute, and probably too young for me.

Oh, and my entire face is peeling. Damn sunburn! At least I got a text from Legoboy at 6 this morning asking if I was ok. It&#8217;s unbelievably nice to know that someone cares enough to ask sometimes. Now I must go pay for my room. I&#8217;ve been staying for free for the last day and a half, so I&#8217;d better fess up and cough up.
