I will never be straightedge.
  
Hooray for going to random parties with a bottle of cider.
  
Hooray for slint-core australian bands.
  
Hooray for creating folk-song-singing monsters and flame-throwing monsters merely through conversation.
  
Hooray for all the kids I ever met in Auckland being at this party.
  
Hooray for sending texts to yourself because it&#8217;s free.

Slightly less hooray for wigging out a little and walking home.

And then HOORAY again for legoboy rescuing me and then going for burgers and crashing out in his room watching family guy.
