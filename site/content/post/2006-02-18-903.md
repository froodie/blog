<div id="fb-root">

Today I was wandering home after a lovely, though short, time in Spiddal. Gar dropped me to Salthill and I dawdled along, buying a pain au chocolat, daffodils and some yummy apples along the way. The day is glorious, but the coolest thing that I heard was a grandfather asking his tiny granddaughter (about three) &#8220;An mbeidh smoothie beag agat?&#8221;

Also, a cyclist nearly crashed into me when I was crossing the road, and I felt awful cos he had to put the chain back on his bike (it wasn&#8217;t really my fault, but still). I offered to help and you&#8217;d swear I&#8217;d given him an apple and some daffodils. Kindness is key, kids. And all along the canal there were lovers and friends and I fair floated home, so glorious it was.

And now I must go home. Anyone in Limerick, go to either dolan&#8217;s or the boatclub tonight and I will probably see you there!
