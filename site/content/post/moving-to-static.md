I don’t blog very often. Calling me a sporadic blogger would be overly generous. I’ve probably used Facebook for much of my longer-length bits and pieces over the past few years. On Thursday I’d a day off work and wrote a diatribe about the scourge of “like and share” scams on Facebook. I posted it to Facebook, where it got surprisingly little traction (maybe because I was being patronising, maybe because people only share nonsense on Facebook, not anything useful).

I realised not long after posting that it was actually more of a blog post than a Facebook post, and I decided to add it to my very neglected blog at niria.in. This was a WordPress installation which I had last posted to (and probably updated) back in 2017. So not only was it lonely and sad, it was full of vulnerabilities. I tried to log in and promptly crashed the whole site. 

When my (extremely talented software engineer) boyfriend arrived home, I asked him for some help. He suggested it might be time to try a different, more secure route, namely using a static site generator which I could couple with free hosting, thereby saving myself
