To qualify this, I find poo amusing.

[thefanboy][1]{.lj-user} and the BoyBandSuperhero came up with this one
  
last night while celebrating their many successes of the day by standing
  
around in Indigo. They were teasing me about my lovelife.

&#8220;He&#8217;s fallen for you, you know. Fallen like a Poo into the Toilet Bowl
  
of Love.&#8221;

<small><b>I</b> think it&#8217;s funny anyway</small>
