hello. being home for the weekend is kind of cool. my mum is being all ayurvedic and made me yummy soup with loads of mung beans in it. this wasn&#8217;t what i expected.

went shopping for a dress to wear to a wedding. it&#8217;s purple, with bows on it.

seeing people is great. i also got to do the door for r&p in their bar, and saw a good gig. Vertigo Smyth. He sings lovely songs, and has a gorgeous voice. and he&#8217;s so shy about it, it&#8217;s utterly endearing. i like being on the door, for some odd bizarre reason. now i&#8217;m at captain jimowen&#8217;s house, explaining to him why livejournal is better than those other blog sites. yeeech.
