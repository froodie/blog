How many days have I got left to do about a million things and see about a bazillion people? Not many, if any..
  
Managed to hand in my glasses to get fixed (I broke them drunkenly, back on the Drunken night of Staff Partyness) and have sorted out some of my photos. I have sooo much to do tomorrow (like pack and go to the bank and think about sending off my application for an Aussie working holiday visa&#8230; maybe I won&#8217;t get one, maybe I should just travel Aus and not bother about work&#8230; that way I don&#8217;t need to worry about having  thousands of dollars when I get there. Yeah. maybe brokedly travelling about is the best way to go. I want to put some more music on my MP3 player, cos I&#8217;ve gotten bored of most of the stuff on there. I want to go see Anna, Maeve, Ciara and my Gran.
  
Maybe if i don&#8217;t sleep at all from tomorrow, I&#8217;ll sleep on the plane&#8230;
  
Except I&#8217;ll probably sleep during my Million Hour Wait in the HORRIBLENESS that is Heathrow.

Gah.

I should do a review of the year type update too&#8230;. maybe some other time, eh?
