I completely forgot about the pancakes yesterday, but last night at midnight there were the coolest fireworks to celebrate Chinese New Year. It&#8217;s good that NZ sometimes remembers that it&#8217;s closer to Asia than Europe. Also yesterday I wandered around the Museum, which was partially closed due to flooding from the excellent rains the day before. As were quite a few shops in the city centre.

I would say more, but I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t care that it was a little bit chilly last night, that I had tuna and cheese on toast for dinner or that I did my laundry and watched survivor. I did read a massive novel the night before called Wildacre by Phillipa Gregory, which had a wonderfully EEEVIL heroine but wasn&#8217;t a particularly great book. Decided to finish it all anyway though. I&#8217;ve already forgotten how many books I&#8217;ve read, despite my resolution to make careful note of them and to try to read more quality books.

Not really feeling the lonely today, which is nice. I&#8217;m getting used to being here. Should find myself a job somewhere soon though, damn refund hasn&#8217;t come through yet and isn&#8217;t likely to in the near future. Which is a pity because I really bloody need it at this stage! GAH. Enough internet&#8230; Let me go outside in the air and the sunshine!
