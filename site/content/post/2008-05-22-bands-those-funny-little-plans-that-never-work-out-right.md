I love how you can be wandering along with a vague future plan in your head one day, and the next everything has changed. A couple of days ago, the idea for the next year was that I would move out of where I&#8217;m living at the end of July, into somewhere a bit more central, smaller and nicer, and therefore more expensive. Then in January I would hope for another contract to follow on from the current one. And in the meantime I would do my best to pay off my loan. 

Then, out of the blue, a friend said she was going to South-East Asia for three months in March. And now the plan is to pay off the loan, move home to my parents&#8217; house for a few months and save like the clappers, and then head off with her. Initial plans are to visit New Zealand for a few weeks in February, then meet up with my friend in March for 8 weeks or so in South-East Asia. And this whole idea has made me so happy. I absolutely love it. The nature of my job means that a few months out of the picture shouldn&#8217;t have too much bearing on future prospects or plans, though I haven&#8217;t mentioned my plans to the Dad-Like Boss as yet. Still though! Thailand! Laos! Vietnam! Cambodia! And I&#8217;ll be travelling with someone who understands the benefits of travelling alone, which makes it less likely that I&#8217;ll have to cut and run ðŸ™‚

At the moment, all plans are pretty damn tentative&#8230; the New Zealand idea might not get to happen at all, but the prospect of maundering around somewhere new for a while is overwhelmingly excellent. Anyone going to be in that part of the world early next year? I will do my best to meet up/ visit. 

In other news, I&#8217;ve been deliciously sociable the last few days. There has been meet-ups, parties, dinners, lunches, exhibitions and whatnot. Today is a run up to Dublin to do some work-related stuff, then lunch with the John and then pretty much straight back down. The tragedy of today is that I won&#8217;t have time to see Indiana Jones today. FORTUNE AND GLORY, KID! FORTUNE AND GLORY!!!!

(Now if only Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would get their act together enough to realise that not providing WiFi on cross-country trains is just laziness on their part, pure and simple, and I could post this MoFo)
