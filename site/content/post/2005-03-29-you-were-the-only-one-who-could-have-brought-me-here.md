After a stompy evening of being in a really shitty mood with Jess, who is a sweetie, but even more absent-minded and dependent on male attention than I am (possibly used to be), I ate some ice-cream and played with Jo&#8217;s guitar (which I have now named Joe) and felt millions better. And proceeded to sleep badly, get sneered at by Evan for not paying my rent yet, get very very wet at work because kitchenhanding with a hole in your apron is NOT a smart thing to do. No work tomorrow, but hopefully I&#8217;ll have enough errands to run to keep me awake and alert.
  
My time in Queenstown is pretty much done, I think. I&#8217;m sort of sick of being here. Too much chocolate and not enough wool. I&#8217;m getting COLD. And when I get COLD I get GRUMPY. And when I&#8217;m GRUMPY I&#8217;m NOT MUCH FUN. I&#8217;m starting to become inured to the fabulous views that surround me. Also I have no reason to stay. I can&#8217;t afford to do all those Queenstown things, the ones that the smart people who saved up to come here do all the time. So it&#8217;s off up to Wanaka, to similar views, similar activities, a great cinema and a puzzle centre with a 3D maze. And then it&#8217;s up the West Coast for me&#8230; and across the Tranzalpine, and back to Christchurch, to possibly find work.
  
It&#8217;s becoming apparent (now that I&#8217;ve finally thought about it) that I don&#8217;t have enough money to get to Australia. So I might just try to get a work visa here and stay a while longer in order to save up some money. Apparently it&#8217;s a lot easier than I thought. And I&#8217;d still have enough time to travel OZ and Asia and head back home. I DEFINITELY don&#8217;t have enough money for Central America. That&#8217;s another trip I guess. Money money. It&#8217;s all I seem to think about. Sorry!
