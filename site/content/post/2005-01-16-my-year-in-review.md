Doing the Year In Review thing, where you take the first sentence from the first entry you post each month&#8230; I start the year out by getting dumped and finish it by getting smacked in the face by a prawn. In the middle, there are witches and princesses and bugger. But it&#8217;s really boring.

<!--more LJ-cut because I couldn't foist this upon you unless you were really bored!-->


  
January: Single again. I was going to say alone again, but i think i was alone before anyway.
  
February: I ended up with a spare ticket for the Munster match, and gave it to Keith for his birthday.
  
March: dammit, am being quite distracted by the oscars!
  
April: Nominations for this year&#8217;s sabbatical elections closed at 5pm.
  
May: Last night I had a dream involving kissing.
  
June: On Monday I was dragged to Cobh, to visit Helen Barratt, the White Witch, and hear what I was going to be when I grew up.
  
July: I&#8217;ve been out a lot, so I&#8217;ve had no chance to post here&#8230;
  
August: Last night I went clubbing with a princess, a pirate, pele, some pink ladies and a priest.
  
September:  Don&#8217;t ever get ill if you don&#8217;t have travel insurance!
  
October: It&#8217;s a beautiful day out there today!
  
November: Buggerit! I really am working for the man.
  
December: In other news. I got smacked in the face by a prawn.
