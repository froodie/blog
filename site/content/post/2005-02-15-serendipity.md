Many things give me joy:

I found a [bookcrossing][1] book! My first one ever! It&#8217;s Bee Season by Myla Goldberg, and I&#8217;m just about to release Riddley Walker into the wild. Or rather, into a phone box! It&#8217;s the best plan ever. And the karma feels great!

It&#8217;s SUNNY

I&#8217;m going to check out penguins in an hour&#8230; well, less than an hour&#8230; and I haven&#8217;t packed yet, even though I&#8217;m leaving tomorrow morning at a rediculous time of the day&#8230; er&#8230; yes.

Life is GREAT! I&#8217;m going to invercargill tomorrow, stewart island the day after, riverton after that, te anau after that and milford sound and queenstown after that&#8230; phew! ðŸ™‚

Hooray for books and life and music and sunshine and penguins and travelling and meeting random people and happy sweet surprises! ðŸ™‚
