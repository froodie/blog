<div id="fb-root">

Today was one of those days where I didn&#8217;t get up til 11. pm.
  
Didn&#8217;t really want to move. Didn&#8217;t want to not-move. So I stayed there.
  
And I got a text asking me if i was ok or just hibernating. [guyfullerton][1]{.lj-user}, I love ya! ðŸ˜€

Feeling a bit queasy now due to staying in bed all day, but not so bad, much better than I was earlier. The plan is to sleep tonight (if that happens it&#8217;ll be fucking amazing) and have a talk to mel tomorrow.

The reason I&#8217;ve been hibernating all day is that I&#8217;m feeling stuck again. The reason for this is that I was asked to do reception here from the middle of february. Which I&#8217;d love to do, but I have to get out of Auckland. I HAVE TO! If I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll have been stuck here forever.
  
Problem is i&#8217;m getting a little short of money, and I&#8217;ve already said I&#8217;ll take the job. But I **can&#8217;t** It&#8217;s making me feel anxious and scared and awful just thinking about it. Maybe I could do it, but then I&#8217;ll only have time to do a quick rush around the rest of the country. Not a good look for me. especially cos I&#8217;ve decided to just rush around OZ aswell.

Fuck.
