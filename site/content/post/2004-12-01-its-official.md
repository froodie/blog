    </center>In other news. I got smacked in the face by a prawn.<br /> While eating at a Japanese restaurant last night to celebrate Bula Bula&#8217;s Forty-Somethingth birthday, one of the entertaining chefs flipped a prawn and it smacked me wetly right between the eyes. Lucky me!

    Also I took the day off work. I wasn&#8217;t drinking, was home by 10 and in bed relatively early, but felt like shit this morning, leaden, sickly, headachy and miserable. So I called in sick. I did want to try to go in if I felt better later, but basically I still feel like crap. Two more days of being GE&#8217;s bitch and I&#8217;m done. Although they are really nice in there. The team leaders are pretty sound and I ignore the typical office crap that is bound to go on from time to time. I even sometimes enjoy helping someone, even though the person on the other end of the phone is always the idiot, have you ever noticed that? You call customer services, wait 10 minutes to speak to a human and then it&#8217;s an imbecile who tells you they can&#8217;t help you? That&#8217;s me! I&#8217;m the imbecile. Serves you right for asking silly questions and not knowing how to handle yourself financially. Pretty much the reason I don&#8217;t owe anyone money except for my parents. Ever.

    Oh, and I booked my tickets home and paid for them. It&#8217;s official. I will be in Ireland from the 17th of December to the 7th of January. Tell me that there&#8217;s fun being planned and I will try to be there. Three weeks of family bonding sounds like a little too much so I might need an afternoon or a night off from time to time.

    Myself and Top Ho-moDell will be heading to Rotorua early next week for a couple of days of sulphur and cheap bottles of wine. I&#8217;m also torn between going to the K-Road Karnival (sic) on Saturday (i should boycott it for spelling alone, but it would be fun) or going to a FOB Social with Mel from work. I should also be going to the cinema in about 5 minutes to see Bridget Jones, but am unsure if it&#8217;s worth it from <a class="lj-user" href="http://glitzfrau.livejournal.com/">glitzfrau</a>&#8216;s review. Still, a free pass is a free pass, and not to be sneezed at.
