Anyone know where&#8217;s the best place to get a decent-ish range of wool and
  
knitting whatnots for as reasonable a price as possible? For some
  
reason, everyone wants a scarf. And i&#8217;d like to be nice to everyone, but
  
as economically as possible.
  
Also, if anyone is in a stitchnbitch or knitting group that wouldn&#8217;t
  
mind a very n00b and very temporary member tagging along for a few
  
weeks, let me know!
