Since the last time I did the blogging thing, I&#8217;ve been doing more or less the same things, talking to the same people, working the same jobs, complaining about the same things. Three jobs is too many. Therefore from the 31st, I shall be a woman with a mere TWO jobs. the daytime one and the sometimes cleaning one are all that will be left to me. With the free time I get as a prize for removing a chunk of my income I plan to do things, write things, keep in contact with people, get some exercise and fresh air, go places, read more, meet more people and have more fun. What is more likely to happen is that I spend every evening sitting on the couch eating and watching tv.

News:

1. I got older, in an It Was My Birthday sort of way. To celebrate we watched Touching the Void. Woo.
  
2. My family (minus dog) are all coming to visit for Christmas, which will be spent on Waiheke Island.
  
3. I am feeling tired of being in Auckland, and doubly tired of working. I like Auckland, but feel like I&#8217;ve been doing too much work stuff and nowhere near enough holiday stuff.
  
4. Legoboy drew me a legoboy doodle. Although he shall no longer be referred to as Legoboy, due to the absence of LEGO anywhere in any original or artificial orifice. (well, that I know of) I like my doodle a lot. It&#8217;s rather large and internal. and should probably not be called a doodle, because he is quite good at doodles, and if a doodle is good it gets called art sometimes.
  
5. I&#8217;m getting rather large and blobby. The combined effects of no exercise and not eating properly in an eating takeaway all the time sort of way. This is not good. I want to be lean and tanned, not pale and flabby like a dead fish. Otherwise there is no point in my Birthday Present To Myself, a hole which is yet to be poked in my bellybutton flesh.
  
6. Terry Pratchett is going to be in Whitcoulls on Queen Street on November 1st, at LUNCH TIME. I&#8217;ll have to go. even if i can only stay for two minutes. SQUEE
  
7. I haven&#8217;t gone out this weekend. It&#8217;s now 1am on Saturday morning. This will not be a crazy weekend.
  
8. I have no work on monday, due to Labour Day. What Joy!
  
9. Resident Evil: Apocolypse was silly fun. I need to attend Kick-Ass Classes. This may occur in conjunction with becoming lean and tanned. Or more probably, will be another one of those things I never get around to doing.
  
10. I really want to do something creative, but have no idea of where to start. Getting time to do something in would be nice I suppose. and SPACE. I will have plenty of both before too long. Perhaps a month is too long?
