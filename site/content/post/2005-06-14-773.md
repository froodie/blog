There is a rob and a jemery (apparently it&#8217;s Kiwi for Diarmuid) on my couches. my couch-colony of irish boys has been established. everyone should bring home a random irish or scot or welsh or even english person and let them sleep on their couch. it makes for good chats. it helps if you&#8217;ve met someone who knows them though. (they are not actually random, Rob is a UL viking and all round good guy, and Diarmuid is his mate)
  
Hooray for bustling about and making them cups of tea and stuff. And for &#8216;back of the hand&#8217; and other such phrases from the motherland.
  
Work tomorrow, then Mr and Mrs Smith with [homagenz][1]{.lj-user} hooray.

I am glad I don&#8217;t live in a leaky flat. Having water dripping onto your face would be horrible
