I&#8217;m at home at my parents&#8217; house for a couple of days, and it&#8217;s striking just how often they are talking to friends or family. I have a terrible tendency to keep in contact with people who are right in front of my face, and not really put the effort into maintaining friendships which are longer distance or less online.
  
It means that my connections suffer. I found myself just last week contemplating calling a friend for a chat, but not actually doing it because I didn&#8217;t want to intrude on her Sunday evening.
  
All this serves to make maintaining connections with people a lot more difficult. I moved to Dublin a year ago and I&#8217;m currently interning at an arts organisation/venue/centre. If it weren&#8217;t for that, choir, my occasional forays into the land of roller derby, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d speak to anyone bar my mother and my lovely friend Maeve who lives in West Cork.
  
My visit home was, for the main part, a dash to make it to choir practice with Anc√≥r, my choral alma mater. It was lovely to slot right back in again and feel like a part of a group. Then I called in to the Limerick Roller Girls table quiz to shouts of &#8220;Oh my GOD what are you doing here?&#8221;. A quick drink and a round of gleeful hellos and hugs and I was off home.
