Once again, I spent Monday tired and cranky. I didn&#8217;t want to do anything and everything was terrible.
  
Then I went to choir practice and everything was wonderful.

With the world and its mother talking about wellness, mental health and mindfulness, and every other person posting pictures of their 5-k runs, let me tell you about another, non-sweaty way to get the happy hormones pumping.

Singing. It&#8217;s ace. And if you do it in a group situation, it&#8217;s even better. Honest!

### Good for your heart:

I never realised that going to choir practice was basically exercise &#8211; but it is gentle aerobic exercise that works on your muscles. Singing can also affect your heart rate &#8211; modulating it and slowing it down. The thinking behind this is that when you sing, you&#8217;re breathing in a regular way and this in turn slows the heart rate. There has even been a study that claims the heart rates of people singing in a group tend to synchronise. I know I sing a lot better when I&#8217;m fitter. It&#8217;s easier to modulate

Some of the science suggests that singing alone benefits, but that group singing is even better. According to Professor Graham Welch, Chair of Music Education at the Institute of Education, University of London:

> “Singing has physical benefits because it is an aerobic activity that increases oxygenation in the blood stream and exercises major muscle groups in the upper body, even when sitting. Singing has psychological benefits because of its normally positive effect in reducing stress levels through the action of the endocrine system which is linked to our sense of emotional well-being. Psychological benefits are also evident when people sing together as well as alone because of the increased sense of community, belonging and shared endeavour.&#8221;

### Good for your brain:

Singing in a group has had many reported benefits for people with mental health difficulties.

I&#8217;d love to see singing &#8211; and choral singing specifically, become more common in primary and secondary schools. Control, discipline, listening and being awesome are some of the things that it teaches.
