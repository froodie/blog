I am a lil bit shaky today. I&#8217;m not sure why. Maybe not having eaten
  
anything yet might be the cause of it. I haven&#8217;t been sleeping right
  
for the past while either. It&#8217;s hard to sleep in a room that&#8217;s a lil
  
bit bigger than my bedroom back home, but which contains five
  
strangers. The mattress here are fantastic, firm and new and
  
comfortable, the pillows are plump and happy, the sheets are crisp, but
  
for some reason I slept better in Oamaru, where the bed sagged in the
  
middle, the pillow was on its last legs, the sheets itched and a street
  
light shone in my eyes all night. Oh, and the plan for onward travel
  
has fallen through, so I&#8217;m going to the dark side and booking a kiwi
  
experience pass that will get me around the Catlins coast, all the way
  
up to milford sound and then back down to queenstown. The german chicks
  
changed their plans completely and never told me. Nice. Must try to get
  
a seat on the bus today, for no doubt it will leave ridiculously early
  
tomorrow.

I finished Riddley Walker this morning. I&#8217;m still not sure how I feel
  
about it. But it was good. I \*heart\* Hoban. Must try to find a copy of
  
The Mouse and His Child. One of the best children&#8217;s books I&#8217;ve EVER
  
read. And I&#8217;ve read a few.

Eh, and unrelatedly: You know when you hear a voice behind you and
  
you&#8217;re convinced it&#8217;s someone you know, even though you know they&#8217;re at
  
least 2 hours away by air? There are three boys playing some shooty
  
type of game behind me, and one of them sounds exactly like Andy, the
  
manager in Papa Jacks. Which is strange. Although he _might_ have come down to Dunedin on his days off, and he _**might**_ have developed a completely different back of his head. Somehow I doubt it.

Last day in Dunedin is being spent the same as all the other days, more or less. Oh well.
  
Oh, and I&#8217;m wearing a headscarf and hooped earrings and a striped shirt and I feel like a PIRATE! YARR!
