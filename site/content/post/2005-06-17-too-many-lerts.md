Somehow, in spite of what felt like ooodles of lovely sleep, my brain is in shutdown mode and my eyes are closing. I have become the sort of temp that REAL people despise. The ones with no work ethic, who turn up late and fall asleep at every possible opportunity. I felt so refreshed this morning, I&#8217;ve no idea why this is happening. Did Kamala put a sleeping-draught in the samosas she made for morning tea (mmmmm samosas)?

**Five minutes later**
  
I am completely awake after an email from jackie gave me the mental image of [thefanboy][1]{.lj-user} on roller skates. It&#8217;s going to happen. Oh my yes.

Ricoh is brilliant. He&#8217;s very very smart and articulate, has a near-perfect sense of comic timing and about ten million screws loose. He even manages to pull off The Mangy Haircut (almost). If he and my
  
brother were to have babies, OH! what babies they would be.
  
[thefanboy][1]{.lj-user}, don&#8217;t tell him I said any of that. He might get a swelled head, which would look Very Odd atop his skinny body. Like a Mangy Lollipop. (can we call him that anyway?)

Rob and Jemery are also awesome, and so far as I can tell, are now People Who Visit Our Flat, and as such, can call up whenever, so long as there are no haircuts involved.

[amphigori][2]{.lj-user} is also Very Very Awesome. Hooray for tea and cookies and chats, even though they were sort of interspersed with giggling so hard that there was PAIN.

Talking about it afterwards, I realised that it was just a normal night. The Irish Boys came over and ate pizza, I baked cookies, Jackie called over for tea, Bee rang Ross, Ricoh got a haircut. That&#8217;s pretty much all that happened. You DEFINITELY had to have been there.
