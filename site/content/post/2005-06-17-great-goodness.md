This evening&#8230;.

was a giggle-fest of mammoth proportions. Like rabid schoolgirls we were. I&#8217;m not even sure how much of it was real and how much wasn&#8217;t.
  
Jackie, Rob, Diarmuid, Ricoh, Ross, Shisca, Stu and I were just sitting around and talking absolute bollocks. And cutting Ricoh&#8217;s hair. Comedic Productions. Baking Cookies. The whole was a hilarious behemoth of flatful fun. I don&#8217;t know. I really don&#8217;t. But I&#8217;m going to bed now. And sleeping a sugar-fuelled sleep.

&#8220;That&#8217;s so chemotherapy&#8221;
  
&#8220;No, it&#8217;s post-chemo.&#8221;

Tomorrow is friday. I get to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in HOURS. This will be fun.
