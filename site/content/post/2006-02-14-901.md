Early this morning I dreamed that I was dreaming about going out. And I dreamed I was waking up in my own bed while having flashbacks about going out. Then I woke up and realised that I was not in my own bed, and that I&#8217;d been out on the piss and had been disgustingly drunk and was now in bed with someone i really shouldn&#8217;t be in bed with. He gave me a tshirt and pointed me at the shower and went to make tea. And I wandered off to talk to his housemates. Then, for some reason, we went for a walk and then went sailing. And I realised that this was quite improbable and then I actually woke up, in my own bed.

It was so vivid. And especially odd because I must have been half waking up, then fell back asleep and thought that the ACTUAL waking up part was a dream. So no, I didn&#8217;t score with anyone inappropriate last night. But I still half-remember that first kiss.
