Thanks so much to everyone who let me know what their leagues are up to! Let me know if I’ve missed anything and I’ll do my best to update.

## In this edition:

  * [Spotlight][1] on DRD&#8217;s D2 triumph

## Spotlight {#spotlight}

It’s a pretty quiet month on the home game front so rather than doing a preview, I’m just going to review what was one of the biggest events ever in Irish roller derby, DRD Charter heading to D2 Playoffs/Champs in Pittsburgh.

Let’s get one thing straight &#8211; they weren’t even on the initial guest list. They were about a 4th round invitation &#8211; a bunch of leagues weren’t able to go and finally DRD got the call and despite the lateness, they said YES, HECKIN YES WE WILL DO THIS THING.

And boy HOWDY did they do it!

As 16th seed, The Mighty Dubs took the underdog mantle with relish, knocking out the 1st seed, Auld Reekie Roller Girls, in the first game of the tournament. They absolutely knocked the socks of the roller derby world all weekend.

They continued their streak by beating No Coast Roller Derby later in the day to qualify for Champs. Then the following day they beat Naptown Roller Derby in the Champs seeding game.

I should probably mention here that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE GAMES were extremely close. Like, people with cardiac issues should probably not have been watching/listening.

The third day of the tournament didn&#8217;t go Dublin&#8217;s way, as they lost to pals Paris Roller Derby in the semi and then once more to Naptown in the 3rd place playoff. But they played well, they played hard and they played like DUBLIN and they won a million fans in the process. Check out some of the reactions from Twitter:
