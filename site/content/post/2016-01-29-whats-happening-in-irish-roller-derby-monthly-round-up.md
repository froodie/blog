It&#8217;s noses to the grindstone for most of the leagues in Ireland over the next few months &#8211; lots of training, recruitment, bootcamps and scrimmages around the country. Here&#8217;s a quick round up of what&#8217;s happening in February!<figure style="width: 477px" class="wp-caption alignright">

### Dublin VS Belfast &#8211; January 30th &#8211; Shoreline Leisure Centre, Greystones.

My top Derby pick for this month is actually in January, and it&#8217;s tomorrow! Dublin Roller Derby are hosting Belfast Roller Derby for a double header and it promises to be fast and furious. Dublin and Belfast have gone head to head a more than a few times over the past few years. As the only two full WFTDA member leagues on the island, the stakes are that little bit higher.

First game of the day is Dublin Roller Derby A vs Belfast Banshees, Belfast&#8217;s A-Team. DRD &#8211; A is currently ranked at 19th in Europe, and 142nd in WFTDA. Belfast is 54th in Europe and 258th in WFTDA. The stats will tell you that Dublin are likely to take the win here by a fairly significant margin, but the Belfast Banshees have had some great experience over the last year with the newly formed UK Roller Derby Championships, charging home to win their T3 Division, coming third in division playoffs and winning promotion to the T2 National North division for the coming season. The new season of the UKRDA championships is beginning on February 13th, so the Banshees will want to give a good account of themselves in tomorrow&#8217;s game.

The second game of the day features DRD C hosting the Norn Iron Maidens, Belfast&#8217;s B team. DRD C are currently ranked 115th in Europe, the Maidens are at 226. Again we&#8217;re most likely looking at a Dublin win, but a close game will still see the Belfast players creeping upwards in the rankings.

First whistle at 12.30, and the second game begins at 15.15. It&#8217;s well worth coming along for both, but if you can only get to one, make it the first one to see the two best teams across Ireland in action. (and hey, if you enjoy that, you might stay for the second game too!)

Quick word of warning &#8211; the game is being held in GREYSTONES, not the usual DRD venue of Tallaght! Set your sat navs accordingly!
