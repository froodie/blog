Don&#8217;t you just love the feeling you get when you&#8217;ve been engrossed in a book for hours and you&#8217;ve completely disregarded reality, to the point that you&#8217;ve forgotten that there&#8217;s someone else in the room, and you finish the book and it feels like you&#8217;ve been asleep for a hundred years?
  
It&#8217;s a sort of a poignant, satisfied sort of feeling. You&#8217;re glad you&#8217;ve read what you&#8217;ve been reading, but you want to stay in the moments created by the author and you know you can&#8217;t.

Sigh.
