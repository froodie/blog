Who&#8217;s been a naughty girl? That would be me! After a weekend of being a drunken reprobate in training, I am tired, sore and sated and kind of embarrassed because some of the sating was done by one of the guys who works in the hostel here.
  
Will start exploring outside of Auckland next week&#8230; I want to visit the north of the north island.
  
Oh, and someone is shooting a movie in the alley beside the hostel. So there&#8217;s a big moon thing for the street lighting, and the alley&#8217;s all done up like a war zone. It makes for an interesting hostel life.
  
I&#8217;m tired now after very little sleep last night \*hem\* and lots of yummy food and a big glass of wine, so I&#8217;m going to slob on the couch some more. I&#8217;m getting quite good at that.
