I was sick yesterday. That is actually a lie, but I was very tired and didn&#8217;t want to go to work. So I didn&#8217;t. While there is no need for me to really justify my decision, I&#8217;ll just say that I am travelling and therefore not all about my job. If I was all about my job, I would be even more dull than I currently appear to be.
  
Instead I slept rather a lot, and went to look at a flat with TheSNURGLE The Dotey One and the BoyBandSuperhero, after which we went and had breakfast/lunch/dinner en famille.

I was getting all excited about the Cocktail Party that I was planning on attending, and there was much getting ready. Until CaptainTom texted me to tell me that it was actually on Saturday. Which it clearly states on the invitation, which is stuck to my wall and which I have read numerous times since it landed in my letterbox. But I have a bizarre blindness when it comes to days, dates, months and suchlike, and somehow Saturday 11th became Friday 10th.
  
Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t turn up at anyone&#8217;s flat in full cocktailed regalia, but now that I&#8217;m telling you about it on the internets, you can mock me and call me Shit for Brains. (which was going to be my new name, but I&#8217;ve changed my mind). Instead, CaptainTom and I went from being mutually imaginary to substantial, and had coffee and fun and chats and high-pitched giggles and things, met and and and went to the park and swinged and sang and rolled down hills.
  
And NOW it&#8217;s today, and I am newly minted and have bought food and that&#8217;s about it. Hooray for everything indeed.
