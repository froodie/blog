I hereby request that Seamus M Kennedy reinstate the Monday Rant so that
  
I have something to read of a Tuesday. I&#8217;m remembering the days of the
  
Monday Rant, The Tuesday Retort, The Wednesday Whine and the Thursday
  
Love-In. Work-related boredom needs to be assuaged ASAP.

**Things**

* I had a hugely unproductive but very very lovely weekend. Hooray
  
for Toms.
  
* I am temporarily phoneless, and _I don&#8217;t like it!!_
  
* I finally saw Shaun of the Dead, which people have been telling
  
me I should really watch. They were right. So I watched it.
  
* Batman Begins. YES. It **is** a good Batman movie. Damn good,
  
in fact. Hooray.
  
* My boots broke this morning. Again. I&#8217;m NOT paying another $35
  
to get a new zip. Sigh.
  
* I had cake for breakfast! MMM cake!
  
* [tarahumara][1]{.lj-user}: best of luck in the new job.
  
* [rivet][2]{.lj-user}: in my thoughts.
