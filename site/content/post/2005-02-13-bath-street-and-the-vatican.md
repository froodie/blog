There were festivities last night. And I was getting really disheartened by the Dunedin nightlife (drunken students, crap charty hip-hop, techno in an old church and rednecks dancing on pooltables &#8211; not all in the same place evidently). But then I found Bath Street and ah, it was good. I always said I like places with no dress code, no cover charge, good music and comfortable decor (even better if it&#8217;s dark and you can spit on the floor). Everyone else had gone to the Supermarket and I had wandered in such of fun. And when I found it, it was House night and full of the vibes I enjoy. There was a cover of $5, but it was worth it. I even had to go back to the hostel and find some random germans to bring with me. Charlotte turned up later with Kimily and there was a sense of having a good night. Didn&#8217;t drink a lot, blew off the guys that were obviously hitting on me, and got to bed after random conversations just before six.
  
I also have a plan for onwardly moving&#8230; two of the german chicks are leaving tomorrow in a rented car and I&#8217;m going with them. Yey. I think we&#8217;re going to go along the Catlins coast, possibly dip down to Invercargill, and then take a sort of roundabout route to Queenstown.
  
But first I&#8217;m going to upload some photos and then go buy some bread and make french toast. Mmmmm french toast! ðŸ™‚
