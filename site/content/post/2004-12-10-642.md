In a less than two minute update&#8230;.. i&#8217;m in Taupo for some reason. Heading back to auckland tomorrow but went for LOVELY walk to Huka falls today with Phil Partridge and even took photos. Will put them up soon for your delectation, and you will see how much of a fatass I&#8217;ve become since coming to Auckland. And how little I care. Blisters, Bloody Feet and Sunburn. Woo!
