Gah! Just out of my Media Law exam, an hour before it&#8217;s due to finish. Didn&#8217;t go so well. There was a whole section on legislation that I had to answer a question from. I didn&#8217;t know. I KNEW there was a reason going to class is a good idea. Whoops.
  
I also did one pretty good and one ok question in the Defamation section. Damn you, Law. You&#8217;re an ass.
  
Right now, though, i think I&#8217;ll go sit in the sunshine or something. Irish is tomorow. Written and oral. So tonight i&#8217;ll peg away, but for now, the sun is shining. Exam stress? Me? Ha!
