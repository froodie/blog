Gin and Tonics in the Locke Bar on a Tuesday, whatever the reason, are a bloody good idea. I&rsquo;m a fan, so long as there&rsquo;s someone there to drive me home. I&rsquo;m not sure when I went from thinking that Gin and Tonic was a crazy cat lady drink to thinking that there&rsquo;s nothing quite so refreshing as a G&T with a wedge of lime, and wouldn&rsquo;t be lovely to have a little house for myself, and a kitten or two to keep me company. But here I am, Cat-Lady-in-penury, with no money for a place of my own, and no limes in the fruit bowl, and not even a kitten to show for my hermit-like urges.<

But I&rsquo;ll always have Tuesdays, and I can coo broodily over the evil stray cats that turn up in the neighbourhood from time to time.

Also, if you&rsquo;re looking for something amazing to drink, try this:

Put ice, a shot of gin and a wedge of lime in a highball glass, top up with tonic and throw a shot of raspberry schnapps over the top. YUM! Summer in a glass!
