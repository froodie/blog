I have about five different things to talk about, some nice, some ranty, some not related to anything much at all.

But I will just say that I hate the vulnerability of being a cyclist. Waiting at lights, car pulls up behind me, scummy asshat starts screaming out window. As car goes past me, man thinks it&#8217;s cool to touch my bag, still shouting. **No It&#8217;s Not Cool, Gobshite!**

He gev me road rage!
