<div id="fb-root">
</div>

Today I learned that Nikola Tesla perceived the Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance AND that Horse With No Name was NOT, as I had ALWAYS thought, a Neil Young song. Heh.

Assumptions shattered. Is acoustical even a WORD?

Apparently, I am cute. people thinking this about me makes me go all gooey. Especially if they are people whose opinion I value and who get played by John Cusack in imaginary movies.

Also, considering the fact that [homagenz][1]{.lj-user} has been unable (due to my multiple personas) to cast me in a movie (I was originally Emily Watson, now I&#8217;m Megan Mullally) that I would turn to all of my wondrous imaginary people to tell me. AND I&#8217;m curious about youse as well. And So&#8230;. A POLL ðŸ™‚ hooray!
