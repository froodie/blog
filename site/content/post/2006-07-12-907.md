The Ghama and I drove The Vertiginous One to Galway yesterday to play a gig&#8230; and then we proceeded to miss it. It wasn&#8217;t entirely our fault. It was a LOT shorter than intended due to a lack of PA. Still we got to see all the scary monsters that live on millstreet so that was nice.

We got to eat yummy food also&#8230; Monroes Pizza with chilli chicken, red onions, roasted red peppers, feta cheese and chilli oil over the whole thing&#8230; so good! And then we were accompanying the Duck to get food in Eddie&#8217;s and had malted milkshakes and helped her with her chips. I&#8217;m STILL completely full.

Fun times.
