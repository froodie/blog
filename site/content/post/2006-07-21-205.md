I think I&#8217;m going to have to make a new tag for blogging about the blog. It&#8217;s a silly thing to have to do, but such is my navel-obsessed existence. See, I think it&#8217;d be a great idea to be able to lj-cut sections of a public entry so that they&#8217;re friends-locked. Oftentimes most of the entry is fine, but there&#8217;s be a sentence about work or my crush-du-jour that&#8217;s probably short and/or in brackets and that needs to be locked. The entry will read fine without that particular sentence for anyone not on my flist, but it&#8217;s not long enough to be worth an entirely seperate entry. Besides, where&#8217;s the damn context.

Right&#8230; done. No more blogging about blogging today. Probably.
