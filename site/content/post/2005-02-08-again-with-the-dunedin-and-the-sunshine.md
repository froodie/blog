Yesterday was moderately uneventful, except that when I left the internet cafe there was a massive black cloud obscuring all light, and I eventually got caught in the mother of all downpours. It was great. Thunder, lightening, massive raindrops and rivers instead of streets! I got back to the hostel and was so soaking wet that I put my bag down and ran straight back out again.
  
Fantastic!

Today I got offered a lift to invercargill with two swiss chicks. I accepted, but had forgotten that I&#8217;ve already paid for my next two nights accommodation. Nor have I seen anything at all of dunedin, bar a brief spin around the Octagon. My current thinking is that I should probably stay here until thursday or friday and then head off&#8230;. but now I have to find the random swiss chicks, who stay in a hostel on the other end of town, apparently, and tell them that I&#8217;m crap and couldn&#8217;t be bothered leaving without getting chocolate!

I am feeling very lonely for the last couple of days for some reason. I think it&#8217;s the not knowing anyone, and not having much contact with anyone thing. It&#8217;s hard to remember that I&#8217;m still around, becaue I&#8217;m not really, I&#8217;m somewhere else. But I can&#8217;t help missing people and wanting them to miss me too. I don&#8217;t exactly have a support group here, maybe I&#8217;m too shy. But I don&#8217;t have someone I can randomly text for coffee, who knows me, and my little nutty ways. I think I&#8217;m scared that my randomnesses and throwaway comments scare people who don&#8217;t know me. I don&#8217;t want to come home just yet, but I can&#8217;t stop thinking it. Oh, and I have to get a job again soon.
