I am a published writer. It&#8217;s mad. Yes, I love writing. It&#8217;s something I feel I&#8217;m good at, and when the itch to write hits, there&#8217;s no escaping it, but it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m disciplined about at all.

When the itch does hit, though, the stuff that comes out is not as disgusting as this over-laboured metaphor might imply.

A few years ago, I was working in RTÉ lyric fm on Lyric Notes with Maire Nic Gearailt. One of the features on the programme was The Quiet Quarter. Each day, we&#8217;d play a few minutes of specially commissioned Irish writing, and each week would feature a different writer or theme. My job was to work on the actual recordings. I set up times to record each writer and made sure they were at ease while reading their work&#8230; some of them were actors and professionals, others were people like me, who scribbled in their free time and weren&#8217;t used to sharing it.

Anyway, it was heading to Christmas one year and the plan was to do a Christmas-themed week, using five different writers commissioned by the Máire. When the pieces came in, some of them were brilliant, absolutely beautiful, but there were a couple where, like me, the writer is used to working from inspiration rather than on request.
