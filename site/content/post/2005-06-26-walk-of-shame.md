at the moment I am sitting at my Man Thing&#8217;s computer with my pyjamas on (because we were at Svendelmaus&#8217;s house last night for watching Batman in pyjamas) and am trying to figure out a way to get to my flat IN MY PYJAMAS because i forgot that it would be daytime by the time I had to go home.
  
I live at the end of courtenay place in wellington, which is relatively central. This is going to be embarrassing. I&#8217;m NOT getting the bus. This is going to be the ULTIMATE WALK OF SHAME. hahahahahaha
