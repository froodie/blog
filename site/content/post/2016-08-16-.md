So, I&#8217;ve been thinking about The 8th Amendment and Ireland&#8217;s Abortion laws because I&#8217;m hopeful that discussion of a Referendum will happen after the election. Trying to take all of the emotion, rhetoric and wishful thinking out of the equation, here&#8217;s what I think will happen if the 8th Amendment is repealed.

1) It will still be EXTREMELY difficult to get an abortion in Ireland.
  
2) &#8220;Regular&#8221;* abortion will still be easier to get in the UK and we will still see a majority of people travelling.
  
3) &#8220;Worthy&#8221;* abortion in tragic or difficult cases will still be a battle in Ireland requiring lots input from a number of doctors/psychiatrists but will at least be possible for people in difficult circumstances.

It&#8217;s not going to change a whole lot, not for a long time, and any scaremongering about &#8220;abortion on demand&#8221; is genuine bullshit so please don&#8217;t get swept up with the craziness.

Not wanting a referendum on this is a deal-breaker for me in the upcoming election, severely limiting the number of candidates I&#8217;ll be giving a preference to ðŸ™‚

Am I wrong? What do YOU think would realistically happen if we repealed the 8th tomorrow?

(Regular Abortion: People who are pregnant in the first trimester and just don&#8217;t want to be for whatever reasons are their reasons.
  
Worthy Abortion: The awful edge cases of rape, fatal foetal abnormality, or where the pregnancy is a serious risk to the health of the pregnant person)
