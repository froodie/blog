Strangers are funny old things.  
Last night I was flitting merrily between two groups of people in [Angel Lane][1] as I prefer to do (it stops people getting tired of me), when I was suddenly transfixed mid-flit by an amazingly awesome Tshirt. The shirt in question bore the legend &#8220;Bouli Bouli. Fear sneachta bán&#8221; and a picture of said loveable snowman.   
I let out a shout of joy and began to regale the wearer of said tshirt with my story about how Bouli used to sleep on my couch sometimes. And do you know what the fucker did? He looked confused and a little disgusted and wandered off. What a prick!

(Bouli DID used to sleep on my couch sometimes. I worked in the subtitling bit of a production company in An Spidéal, along with Inspector Gadget and Bouli Sneachta and yer woman from Ros na Rún who was only in it for a bit and went a bit mental.)
