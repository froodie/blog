Am I a real blog yet?
  
I decided to use the incentive of having to start a blog for my Digital Marketing course and become a bona fide blogger. We&#8217;ll see how it works out. I&#8217;ve migrated a bunch of old posts from my LiveJournal days so it feels like I have history, and I&#8217;ll start working on making things look nice tomorrow. And then &#8211; the content! Hold on to your woggles, boyscouts!
