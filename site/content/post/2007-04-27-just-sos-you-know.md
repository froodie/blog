I am happy.&nbsp;

No, I don&#8217;t have a full-time job; but i&#8217;m doing things I enjoy doing and it keeps me going.

No, I&#8217;m not going out with anyone; but that doesn&#8217;t stop me enjoying people&#8217;s company, and I&#8217;ve gotten to kiss some lovely boys this year.

No, I don&#8217;t own a house, nor do I have any plans to buy one; I don&#8217;t know where I want to live when I grow up yet, why would I want a house?

But even if I might sometimes miss knowing how much money i&#8217;ll have by the end of the week, or having someone to loll about in bed reading books with, I am happy. Not full-on joy, mind. But general contentment and satisfaction that comes from a feeling that I&#8217;m living my life how I want to live it.

That&#8217;s all. How are you?&nbsp;
