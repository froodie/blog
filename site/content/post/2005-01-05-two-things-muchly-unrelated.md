Thing Number One: Happy Birthday to [ellen_melon][1]{.lj-user} and [b_sides][2]{.lj-user}. Hope you both have a lovely day of people being sweet because it&#8217;s your birthday.

Thing Number Two: If someone says they need to tell you about some stuff in person, do you automatically assume it&#8217;s got something to do with you? Cos someone said that to me recently, and I jumped to nasty conclusions instantly, and then found out that it&#8217;s got nothing to do with me at all, but it&#8217;s serious, so face-to-faceness is needed.
