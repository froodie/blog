I talk too much.

Also, TractorBoy is bloody great. But unfortunately seems less enamoured of me than I am of him. Oh well. I will see him in a month or two in Wellington, if he still wants to talk to me. We were walking down Queen Street and couldn&#8217;t decided where to eat so we kept walking. Eventually we got to the bottom of Queen St, and to the ferry building. So we went to Devonport and ate there. Sigh. I am sad that time and situation doesn&#8217;t allow for friendships to develop.

Also.. in relation to the semi-poll of the previous week&#8230; He so **WAS** going out with someone! HA! Still, I guess that if you&#8217;re seeing someone, then having a practically constant text conversation with some random chick you&#8217;ve only met once in the mosh pit for System of a Down isn&#8217;t going to go down well with your significant other. Especially not when the person you are texting is a hott foreign chick like me. er. yes.

In other news, meeting people for coffee and catch-ups is great. And I am being asked to go to a party tonight by a guy called Spoon. Would you go ANYWHERE with a guy called Spoon? ha.

Auckland is good for my self-esteem. I&#8217;ve apparently lost loads of weight and am looking really well. Who knew?
