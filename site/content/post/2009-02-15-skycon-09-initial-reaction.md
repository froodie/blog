I am still in bed after the weekend. I pity those that had to get up to travel/get flights etc.
  
Initial reactions over the weekend were that it was lovely, lovely, lovely to see all of these people again, the day of the conference itself went very well, the nights went better, and that I should have gotten more sleep on friday night.

Also, CAKE!!  (pic by colmmacc)

The Cake, projected.

 _Edited: I didn&#8217;t bake the cake, just bought one with plain white icing and drew the stuff on top_
