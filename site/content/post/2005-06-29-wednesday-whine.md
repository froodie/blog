Hi&#8230;

&#8230; long time no see.

I feel like one of those people who hasn&#8217;t seen someone in a while and is guilty about not having seen them so spends about a week plucking up the courage to meet up and make awkward conversation.

I&#8217;m still here. I&#8217;m just a bit quiet. I&#8217;m tired, I&#8217;m not liking the fact that my last month in new zealand is going to be spent doing data entry in an office instead of making memories and doing nice things.
  
I&#8217;m having problems booking my flights home. Partly because I&#8217;m not sure what way I want to go. Partly because I have no phone or email access at work at the moment. And mostly because the thought of leaving is ripping me to pieces. I really don&#8217;t want to leave. It&#8217;s a combination of not wanting to say goodbye to everything that I love about New Zealand and not wanting to go back to Limerick. I can already feel it. The box that is the Me that I was a year ago (it&#8217;s not a fucking coffin. i know this. but it&#8217;s a BOX. I don&#8217;t want to go in a box!). The stultifying atmosphere and lack of freshness that is the old town of Limerick, where everything new and good is crushed with disappointment and cynical fuckheads hours after it is born. I&#8217;m painting things as worse than they really are. And it will be lovely to see people again. But that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m feeling now. [homagenz][1]{.lj-user} is going away on saturday for a week, and lovely plans were being fomented to visit him while he was away. But things didn&#8217;t quite make it past the &#8216;wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome&#8217; stage. I will be lonely when he is gone.
  
There are still good things. People are still great. Hugs and kisses are great. Meeting new peoples and knitting with them is also great.
  
But I&#8217;m not a happy froodie today. Nor will I be tomorrow. Or the next day. But no job= no money = no making yummy treats and knitting scarves and paying rent or having adventures.
  
Reality DOES Bite. Pizza is only sometimes the answer.

Sorry for whining. But that&#8217;s how it is.
