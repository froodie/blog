Just arrived in sydney airport. It&#8217;s a lovely sunny day. All I want to do, though, is curl up into a ball somewhere and recuperate from all of the sundering that&#8217;s been going on. I miss my Tom, my Jackie, my flatties and all the rest of my wellington family.

FUCKING FUCK. I WANNA GO HOME (to nz) or else just go straight to ireland. Nice and all as it seems here, it&#8217;s not where my head wants to be right now. Gotta go find guy.

Much love, more later when I&#8217;m not so tired and upset.
