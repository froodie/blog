I am, of course, talking about my phone.

There&#8217;s a lot of guff about how bad phones are for your social interactions etc. But there&#8217;s no getting away from the fact that we no longer set a definite arrangement to meet someone days in advance, we just text them or ring them to set something up, and refine the arrangement as we go.

I&#8217;ve been phoneless for the past week, and I&#8217;ve felt it. Oh my, I&#8217;ve felt it. I&#8217;d been intending to go out and have a bit of a life, but I don&#8217;t feel comfortable wandering around a city I don&#8217;t know particularly well without some sort of safety net. I managed well enough this weekend, by finding the duck and using her to meet up with the ghama.

Also, I&#8217;ve got talented friends. And I mock less talented people who aren&#8217;t my friends far too much as a result&#8230; must learn tolerance ðŸ˜€

P.S. I got my phone back.
