It&#8217;s funny to think that it&#8217;s November-y back home. Here it&#8217;s summer holiday weather. We sat outside O&#8217;Carrolls, an Irish bar, for a few hours this evening, in t-shirts or string tops, and jandals. Myself, Caroline, Liz and Gary and Phil decided to bring lots of randoms along to the pub with us. So we were joined by what turned out to be 5 Hot Guys.

Which was nice!
  
I love just watching how conversation flows in groups. For some reason the people on either side of me usually seem to be talking to the people on the other side of them, so I get quite a lot of time to observe how it goes. It always looks so easy, so I&#8217;m not sure why I find it difficult. I always seem to sort of flit somewhere, say something random and the flit somewhere else.

And I know the first person on the world who had a toe surgically taken from her foot and attached to her hand. Isn&#8217;t that the coolest? **She** is the coolest, one of the nicest, friendliest, most considerate and funniest people I&#8217;ve met while travelling, and she&#8217;s only 19.

I&#8217;m a lil wee bit tired from all the beer now, so i&#8217;m going to go have a nice early night. No doubt I&#8217;ll wake up waaaaay too early in the morning, but I might even get some breakfast out of it so it&#8217;s not all bad!

(see what I mean about the random flitting?)
