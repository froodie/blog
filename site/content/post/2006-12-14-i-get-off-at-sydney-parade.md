I&#8217;m currently reading the latest Ross O&#8217;Carroll-Kelly book, &#8220;Should have got off at Sydney Parade&#8221;. I read it on my two-stop commute. The book&#8217;s not as funny as the other ones, but I&#8217;m enjoying the bits where he&#8217;s in Blackrock&#8230; &#8220;Oh my god, I, like TOTALLY have my lunch there&#8221; etc.

AND&#8230; guess where there nearest DART station to my house is? tee hee hee hee. Oh, the resonance!
