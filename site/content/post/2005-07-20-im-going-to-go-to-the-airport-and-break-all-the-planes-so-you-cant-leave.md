Some things:

*Yesterday&#8217;s List was Passport Photos, Tickets, Travel Insurance and Australian Visa. All done, well I got them all done today anyway.

*Today&#8217;s list is Post Office stuff and calling Shipping companies. Soon it will be done.

*Ciara TFY is great and lovely.

*Theme Hospital has eaten my brain. I stayed up playing it until _craazy_ O&#8217;Clock this morning.

*Being sociable is very lovely and much fun. Thank you very much indeed to the House of York for a great evening on Monday.

*I need to organise some kind of fun, in an &#8220;I&#8217;m leaving, come one come all and celebrate&#8221; sort of a way. I need suggestions 🙂

*I want to go to the Bloody Ballet and do about a BAZILLION other things before I go.

*Karori tomorrow! W00t! 😀
