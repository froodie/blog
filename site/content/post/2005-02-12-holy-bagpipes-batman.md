Charlotte and I were just wandering around town, checking out secondhand bookshops and having coffee and being exhausted and stuff, and then BAM, the octagon is filled with HORDES of bagpipers. there&#8217;s some kind of competition on today I think.
  
THe best bit was at the end where about eight bands lined up together and all marched down George St playing Scotland the Brave. Stirring indeed. No matter who you are or where you&#8217;re from, a bazillion bagpipers going right past your ear is an unforgettable experience. Probably.
  
Bonded with Charlotte today, she&#8217;s a pretty cool chick from Perth, but with a plummy english influence on her accent, which is cool with her husky voice. She came over here to escape the crazy constant 35degree heat, and she&#8217;s done a pretty good job of it. I&#8217;m in boots and a jacket today (i am wearing other things too) which is overkill, but not by much.
  
And now for a short nap, followed by more Riddley Walker. I&#8217;m hugely enjoying it, but it&#8217;s a bit of an effort to read. Hoorah! I also have a Jane Austen and the rest of the Manufacturing Consent to get through, but I figured that I needed a break after elections in Central America and before starting on Indochina wars. I need to read more non-fiction.
