Noirin made me do it.

1)&nbsp;&nbsp; My first brush with stardom was in Brownies, when I was chosen to play Brown Owl in our christmas play. This was closely followed by my&nbsp;first ever &#8220;Bad Guy&#8221; part as The Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland for my ballet school.

2)&nbsp; My first car was mine for a total of 9 hours, and then it died of cartwheeling.

3)&nbsp; I used to have a crush on Aladdin. Yes, the cartoon character.

4)&nbsp; Bouli slept on my couch. Twice. He sucks his thumb.

5)&nbsp; I come second in Karaoke competitions. A lot. It&#8217;s like my thing.

I&#8217;m too tired to tag anyone. and everyone&#8217;s been tagged. but do it again if you&#8217;d like.
