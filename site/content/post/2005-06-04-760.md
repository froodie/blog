So. I&#8217;m alive. And have napped, showered and been HUGGED into insensibility by Legoboy, which is nice ðŸ™‚ It feels so bizarre to be back after so long. Most of the friends I made here were transient like me, so they&#8217;ve all gone away, bar Caroline and Jojo. Who I will be seeing tomorrow. TractorBoy is going to come into town from Pukekohe to pick me up and whisk me away from it all. I&#8217;ve forgotten what he looks like.

Legoboy is doing really well. He&#8217;s all svelte and looking well, has gotten into a creative groove so there are canvases (mostly non-blank) all over his room, and he has a sweet Woman Thing who I have yet to meet. There was a pile of clothes here, the contents of which I had forgotten, so I&#8217;m wearing a black and white stripey jumper. Nautical tastic. Bought in Honour of Skipper Tom. Hooray for collectible Toms!

It&#8217;s almost like I never left, except that the people are different and there are different blankets on the beds and a new tv. Hooray for Auckland and warmer-than-wellington weather and free texts at the weekend and Legoboy being a legend of impressive proportions. Ha. That sounds like I was talking about his &#8220;proportions&#8221;. Not quite what I intended, but it&#8217;s staying there.
