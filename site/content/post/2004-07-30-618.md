Well, I&#8217;m here. And I like Auckland, so I think I&#8217;ll stay a while. Need to find a job, and update my CV and open a bank account and AAGH. I&#8217;ve been online for an hour an a half already, looking for somewhere to live, but it&#8217;s hard when ya have no money. I might just live in a backpacker hostel for a while.
