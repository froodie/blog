I&#8217;ve been on a real &#8216;making crap&#8217; kick lately. I&#8217;ve not felt like buying stuff, and am really getting into making gifts for people. This is the last one I made, for le boy&#8217;s birthday, which is on Thursday.  
He seems to like it too, which I was sort of hoping for, given his penchant for geeky clocks and the colour green. In fact, I enjoyed making this so much that I&#8217;m tempted to buy a bunch of mechanisms on ebay and go crazy making clocks. I could even sell them, if I got good ðŸ™‚

Anyway, in other news, I was contemplating having a shoe-painting party on Saturday in my place. You know those fabric plimsol thingies with pictures/patterns on them that you can buy in shoe shops for â‚¬30? Well, buy yourself a pair of plain white ones for a fiver in Dunnes and call over to my gaff. I&#8217;ll stump up a bunch of fabric paint and we&#8217;ll all be trez chiquita for minimal bucks.

Anyone interested? Drop me a comment/message
