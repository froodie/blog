I&#8217;d forgotten how great it is to have a ton of people from home online. Getting all the gossip and remembering how much I adore my maeves. I can&#8217;t wait to see them and just go for icecream and have sillinesses.

In mostly the past few weeks I&#8217;ve realised how irritating it must have been for my lovely friends in the northern hemisphere when I spoke of sunshine and warmth and scanty clothing. (not that this summer&#8217;s been anywhere near good at all. it&#8217;s been crap, but summer&#8217;s summer). You were all shivering and damp and miserable.

Well now you&#8217;re all telling me about your freckles and sunburn and icecream and frizzy hair. Consider yourselves avenged upon me ðŸ˜€

I must away before I wake someone up with my clickity clackety.

I need to get pokeled awake tomorrow.
  
MUST GET OFF MY ASS AND DO SILLY TOURIST THINGS.
  
Who&#8217;s with me?
