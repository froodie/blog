Going home feels SO wrong. It seriously does. It feels like I&#8217;m making the hugest mistake, but that I don&#8217;t have any way of NOT going home.

Having said that, I can feel it approaching. It&#8217;s not all a bad thing. The seeing of people and the many of hugs etc. All of THIS is good, of course. The fact that I might (MIGHT) get a little bit of a Summer after all before I&#8217;m back into the yuk of winter, without so many beautiful clear days (not that I get to appreciate them really and truly) to bring me sun and a little bit of positivity.

Oh, the title of my last entry was said to me by my flatmate Stu today ðŸ™‚
