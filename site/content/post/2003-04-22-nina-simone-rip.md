My bedroom is all shiny and clean, i&#8217;m out of bed, i wrote some of the essay last night and am about to type it up and see where i am relative to my word count. once that&#8217;s done, i&#8217;m going in to college, to face a pretty horrible day.

There&#8217;s the class i&#8217;m skipping now, that i really should be in but i haven&#8217;t left myself the time, there&#8217;s the presentation this afternoon, many meetings, sortings out, conversations that need to be had, not to mention horrible mounds of preparation for german things tomorrow. yeuch

MY OWN FAULT !!!
