      <description>Doing the Year In Review thing, where you take the first sentence from the first entry you post each month&amp;#8230; I start the year out by getting dumped and finish it by getting smacked in the face by a prawn. In the middle, there are witches and princesses and bugger. But it&amp;#8217;s really boring.
January: Single again. I was going to say alone again, but i think i was alone before anyway.</description>
