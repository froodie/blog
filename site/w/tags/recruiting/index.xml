      <description>Recruitment is changing. How people search for their jobs is changing.
 Half of all job searches carried out on Indeed.com today will be on mobile devices (a trend that’s risen by 17% in the last year alone). In fact, across the globe, the mobile job search rate is as high as 83% in some countries. &amp;#8211; See more at: socialtalent.co
 Today I&amp;#8217;ll be looking at mobile job searches from the point of view of the jobseeker.</description>

      <description>I run the @JobfairyHQ twitter account. I have over 3,400 followers &amp;#8211; mostly a mixture of jobseekers, recruiters, and companies I&amp;#8217;ve retweeted who follow me to be nice.
I try to retweet as many Irish jobs as I possibly can. How I do it is to search twitter for tweets tagged with #jobfairy or #irishjobs &amp;#8211; then I run through them and retweet the ones that fit my criteria.</description>
