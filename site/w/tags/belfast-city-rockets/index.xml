      <description>This weekend, Greystones and the East Coast Cyclones will play host to only the second ever roller derby tournament to be held on Irish soil. The last one was in Belfast and was an absolute belter &amp;#8211; with Dublin Roller Derby A coming home the overall winners &amp;#8211; with Belfast Roller Derby in second place and Limerick Roller Derby in third.
This, Queen Bee Tournament, The Battle for the Garden, is focussed on the B-teams and the newer, less-established teams in the country and will feature the host team, Belfast City Rockets, Boom Town Rollers from Dublin, Dublin Roller Derby B and the Waterford City Viqueens.</description>
