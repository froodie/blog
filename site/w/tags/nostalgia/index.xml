      <description>Back when I was doing my Work Experience subtitling weird kids TV shows and Survivor for Irish Language Television (yes, i actually did), I used to spend a phenomenal amount of time on the internet. On a dial-up. When local calls aren&amp;#8217;t actually free in Ireland. And they didn&amp;#8217;t really mind. I can only remember about three times when I was actually on time for work, but nobody every said anything to me about it.</description>
