      <description>I completely forgot about the pancakes yesterday, but last night at midnight there were the coolest fireworks to celebrate Chinese New Year. It&amp;#8217;s good that NZ sometimes remembers that it&amp;#8217;s closer to Asia than Europe. Also yesterday I wandered around the Museum, which was partially closed due to flooding from the excellent rains the day before. As were quite a few shops in the city centre.
I would say more, but I&amp;#8217;m sure you don&amp;#8217;t care that it was a little bit chilly last night, that I had tuna and cheese on toast for dinner or that I did my laundry and watched survivor.</description>
