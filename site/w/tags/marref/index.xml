      <description>This is the reason I’m voting YES with all of my heart. I’m doing it for my friends.
Dear straight friends,
I have friends who have been beaten up, friends who don’t hold hands in public, friends who have only come out to their families in order to ask them to vote yes in the referendum, friends whose families or parts of their families haven’t spoken to them in years because of their sexuality.</description>
