      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t quite seem to get a handle on Dunedin. I&amp;#8217;m not sure why, but it sort of eludes me. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because most of the students aren&amp;#8217;t here, and there are usually around 25,000 of them? I&amp;#8217;m not sure, but I think I could possibly like this town, once I get the hang of it.
Granted, it took me a lot longer than four days to get the hang of Auckland, but this place is so much smaller.</description>
