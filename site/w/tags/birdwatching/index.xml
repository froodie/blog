      <description>Talk about birdwatching!! I just had the most fantastic day out the Otago Peninsula&amp;#8230; We saw oystercatchers, paradise shell ducks, shags, herons, a kingfisher, LOADS of albatross, lil blue penguins and yellow-eyed penguins (hoiho). Also many fur seals. The Albatross is the most amazing bird. Its chest isn&amp;#8217;t strong enough to flap its wings very much, and yet it can fly 150,000 kilometres in a YEAR! It&amp;#8217;s so graceful and dignified and amazing to watch.</description>
