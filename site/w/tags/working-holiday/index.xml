      <description>It&amp;#8217;s funny to think that it&amp;#8217;s November-y back home. Here it&amp;#8217;s summer holiday weather. We sat outside O&amp;#8217;Carrolls, an Irish bar, for a few hours this evening, in t-shirts or string tops, and jandals. Myself, Caroline, Liz and Gary and Phil decided to bring lots of randoms along to the pub with us. So we were joined by what turned out to be 5 Hot Guys.

Which was nice!</description>

      <description>Buggerit! I really am working for the man. GE donated $2.58million to the US Republican party since 1999. Yuk. I&amp;#8217;m finishing in 2 weeks though, so that&amp;#8217;ll stick it to them. Yeah! And I stole about 20 helium balloons today, all printed with GE Money, which is what GE finance is now called in New Zealand. So I&amp;#8217;ve made them scared now, I&amp;#8217;ll bet.
In other news, there has been much fun and also some sleep had.</description>
