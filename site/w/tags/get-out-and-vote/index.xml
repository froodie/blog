      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a quick look at how to vote in an Irish Election. Tongue partly in cheek, but if you follow my steps, you genuinely won&amp;#8217;t go wrong!
Step 1: Learn enough about your candidates to be able to rank them in order of preference. You can do this by visiting smartvote.ie or whichcandidate.ie and seeing which candidates match your views. I recommend also visiting their websites or doing a quick google search to see how many of them are actually gobshites.</description>
