      <description>I had never seen Before Sunrise before tonight. Judge me all you like, but it&amp;#8217;s the truth. Last weekend I was in Dublin for a gig and to visit some friends, one of whom hid it on another friend&amp;#8217;s bookshelf and then texted me once he&amp;#8217;d left to give me a clue that it was there. He probably didn&amp;#8217;t want to get caught trafficing sappy films or something. He&amp;#8217;d mentioned it to me recently, and said that it seemed like the kind of film I&amp;#8217;d enjoy.</description>
