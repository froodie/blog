      <description>I stood up to a street harasser yesterday and I&amp;#8217;m glad I did. Here&amp;#8217;s a fuller version of the story.
First, some context: A train full of people returning from a sporting event is an experience. I got the train from Limerick to Dublin yesterday and the first leg was full of Cork and Limerick supporters on their way home. I was on the train 15 minutes before departure and there were only a few empty seats dotted around the carriages.</description>

      <description>[][1]Image by [bump][2] It&amp;#8217;s been quite a journey to figure out who I am. On my birth cert, my name is Sarah Ann Ryan. I read Anne of Green Gables as a kid and began insisting on the E at the end of Ann &amp;#8211; why wouldn&amp;#8217;t you? My secondary school operated through the medium of the Irish language and insisted I use the full translation of both of my names &amp;#8211; Sorcha Ní Riain.</description>
