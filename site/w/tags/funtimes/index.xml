      <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve ever been curious about Roller Derby, come to the Shoreline Leisure Centre in Bray this Saturday. You&amp;#8217;ll see four games &amp;#8211; including a co-ed and a men&amp;#8217;s game!
The worst thing about the increase in the popularity of roller derby in Ireland is the fact that sometimes events clash and you end up having to miss something you were really looking forward to.
Dublin Roller Derby had invited me to announce at their upcoming double-header against Newcastle Roller Derby&amp;#8217;s Canny Belters and Hull&amp;#8217;s Angels Roller Dames.</description>

      <description>This weekend, Greystones and the East Coast Cyclones will play host to only the second ever roller derby tournament to be held on Irish soil. The last one was in Belfast and was an absolute belter &amp;#8211; with Dublin Roller Derby A coming home the overall winners &amp;#8211; with Belfast Roller Derby in second place and Limerick Roller Derby in third.
This, Queen Bee Tournament, The Battle for the Garden, is focussed on the B-teams and the newer, less-established teams in the country and will feature the host team, Belfast City Rockets, Boom Town Rollers from Dublin, Dublin Roller Derby B and the Waterford City Viqueens.</description>

      <description>Last night, at a lovely barbeque at Dave and Joan&amp;#8217;s to celebrate Mister Dave&amp;#8217;s birthday, I put Hellman&amp;#8217;s Burger Sauce on my burger for the first time. I didn&amp;#8217;t know that time machine transporters came in burger sauce flavour, but they sure as hell do, because when I opened my eyes after that first bite, I was sitting on a green leatherette couch with mirrors on the walls in Burgerland on William Street.</description>

      <description>It’s been fun, since Saturday, waiting for people to finish The Book That Shall Not Be Named so that we could huddle in dark corners to discuss it without hysterical accusations of spoiling. I even set up an IRC channel on intersocs, and people have been dribbling in, saying “I can’t believe it’s over” and then leaving.
It’s odd. There are so many books out there, so many series of books, some of which are awful, but many of which are as good, and some of which are a LOT better than the Harry Potter series.</description>

      <description>Gin and Tonics in the Locke Bar on a Tuesday, whatever the reason, are a bloody good idea. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan, so long as there&amp;rsquo;s someone there to drive me home. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I went from thinking that Gin and Tonic was a crazy cat lady drink to thinking that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite so refreshing as a G&amp;amp;T with a wedge of lime, and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be lovely to have a little house for myself, and a kitten or two to keep me company.</description>

      <description>I was at Wolverhampton at the weekend with the Skynet kids for Lugradio Live 2007.  Despite my immense lack of knowledge of Free/Open Source Software, and my non-contribution to the FOSS community; the amount of fun that was had in the company of the Lugradio lads during Skycon in February (sub-par knob jokes notwithstanding) meant that I decided to make the trek to Wolverhampton to see the boys and possibly have some fun.</description>
