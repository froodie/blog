      <description>FClock, originally uploaded by La Froodie.  I&amp;#8217;ve been on a real &amp;#8216;making crap&amp;#8217; kick lately. I&amp;#8217;ve not felt like buying stuff, and am really getting into making gifts for people. This is the last one I made, for le boy&amp;#8217;s birthday, which is on Thursday.
He seems to like it too, which I was sort of hoping for, given his penchant for geeky clocks and the colour green. In fact, I enjoyed making this so much that I&amp;#8217;m tempted to buy a bunch of mechanisms on ebay and go crazy making clocks.</description>
