      <description>Hangover?, originally uploaded by La Froodie.  I took this pic last summer at my parents&amp;#8217; house. My brother had had a party the night before, and clearly decided to be responsible about the recycling. Or else there&amp;#8217;s a better story. Any ideas?</description>

      <description>Reflection, by Sarah, originally uploaded by colmmacc.  Colmmacc is really as good at cropping photos as he is at taking them. We were driving around Galway at the weekend, and I was snapping away as he drove. He&amp;#8217;s put some of my snaps up on his flickr, and I&amp;#8217;m surprised at how well some of them turned out. Maybe I should buy a *cough* SLR *cough*</description>

      <description>FClock, originally uploaded by La Froodie.  I&amp;#8217;ve been on a real &amp;#8216;making crap&amp;#8217; kick lately. I&amp;#8217;ve not felt like buying stuff, and am really getting into making gifts for people. This is the last one I made, for le boy&amp;#8217;s birthday, which is on Thursday.
He seems to like it too, which I was sort of hoping for, given his penchant for geeky clocks and the colour green. In fact, I enjoyed making this so much that I&amp;#8217;m tempted to buy a bunch of mechanisms on ebay and go crazy making clocks.</description>
