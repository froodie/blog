      <description>[][1]By: Maryland GovPics Recruitment is changing. How people search for their jobs is changing.
 Half of all job searches carried out on Indeed.com today will be on mobile devices (a trend thatâ€™s risen by 17% in the last yearÂ alone). In fact, across the globe, the mobile job search rate is as high as 83% in some countries. &amp;#8211; See more at: socialtalent.co
 &amp;nbsp;
Today I&amp;#8217;ll be looking at mobile job searches from the point of view of the jobseeker.</description>

      <description>So far, a whole bunch of you have read my first efforts at de-complicating the process of recruiting on twitter in my How to tweet a job vacancy post. This next post is specifically for recruiters, be they recruitment consultants, agencies or HR departments. Fairy dust incoming!
Bullhorn Reach By: FaceMePLS
Bullhorn ReachÂ isÂ a godsend for busy recruiters, sure, and a great tool. You can share vacancies via your networks very easily, and you don&amp;#8217;t need to remember to resend your tweet regularly.</description>

      <description>[][1]By: Julie Walraven I run the @JobfairyHQ twitter account. I have over 3,400 followers &amp;#8211; mostly a mixture of jobseekers, recruiters, and companies I&amp;#8217;ve retweeted who follow me to be nice.
I try to retweet as many Irish jobs as I possibly can. How I do it is to search twitter for tweets tagged with #jobfairy or #irishjobs &amp;#8211; then I run through them and retweet the ones that fit my criteria.</description>

      <description>I sent this poster off with a recent application. I&amp;#8217;ll let you know how it goes ðŸ™‚ Applying for a job? There are many of us in the job application boat at the moment, and some are dealing with it better than others. I find it absolutely gut-wrenching to put myself forward to be accepted or rejected. I absolutely hate doing it, but I&amp;#8217;ve been out of work now since I took redundancy in September, so it&amp;#8217;s time to pimp myself out to prospective employers.</description>
