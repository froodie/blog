      <description>This is the second post in my series on the topic of the different treatments I&amp;#8217;ve been on for Depression &amp; Anxiety. I&amp;#8217;m looking at the different types of drugs I was prescribed and I might also tell you how I really feel about people&amp;#8217;s attitude to medicating for depression. Before I say anything else, a disclaimer. These are the drugs I was prescribed, these are the effects and side-effects I personally had.</description>

      <description>Today is Time to Talk Day in Ireland, organised by the Green Ribbon Project.
Weâ€™re making great strides in encouraging people with mental health difficulties, people who are struggling and people who are overwhelmed to reach out to someone and break the silence. From personal experience both as the reacher and the reachee, I wanted to share some tips on how to be reached out to.
The first step is Time It can be difficult to open up to someone and this is doubly true if itâ€™s the first time.</description>

      <title>A guide to voting in GE16</title>

      <description>Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives,Cornell University Library. Here&amp;#8217;s a quick look at how to vote in an Irish Election. Tongue partly in cheek, but if you follow my steps, you genuinely won&amp;#8217;t go wrong!
Step 1: Learn enough about your candidates to be able to rank them in order of preference. You can do this by visiting smartvote.ie or whichcandidate.ie and seeing which candidates match your views. I recommend also visiting their websites or doing a quick google search to see how many of them are actually gobshites.</description>

      <title>Why Iâ€™m voting YES</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/why-im-voting-yes/</link>

      <description>This is the reason Iâ€™m voting YES with all of my heart. Iâ€™m doing it for my friends.
Dear straight friends,
I have friends who have been beaten up, friends who donâ€™t hold hands in public, friends who have only come out to their families in order to ask them to vote yes in the referendum, friends whose families or parts of their families havenâ€™t spoken to them in years because of their sexuality.</description>

      <description>I stood up to a street harasser yesterday and I&amp;#8217;m glad I did. Here&amp;#8217;s a fuller version of the story.
First, some context:
A train full of people returning from a sporting event is an experience. I got the train from Limerick to Dublin yesterday and the first leg was full of Cork and Limerick supporters on their way home. I was on the train 15 minutes before departure and there were only a few empty seats dotted around the carriages.</description>

      <description>This awesome mooncup plushie is by Unicorn Reality This post is aimed at people who menstruate. It may be interesting to those who don&amp;#8217;t, but if you complain about it being about menstruation having read it, I&amp;#8217;m going to mock you.
 I&amp;#8217;ve been hearing about the next great leap in feminine hygiene (now there&amp;#8217;s a phrase I hate with a passion) for quite a few years now. The silicone menstrual cup goes by many names, almost all of them with a touch of the earthmother off them.</description>

      <title>The Good Ship Jobseeker â€“ To intern or not to intern?</title>

      <description>I sent this poster off with a recent application. I&amp;#8217;ll let you know how it goes ðŸ™‚ Applying for a job? There are many of us in the job application boat at the moment, and some are dealing with it better than others. I find it absolutely gut-wrenching to put myself forward to be accepted or rejected. I absolutely hate doing it, but I&amp;#8217;ve been out of work now since I took redundancy in September, so it&amp;#8217;s time to pimp myself out to prospective employers.</description>

      <description>[][1]Image by [bump][2] It&amp;#8217;s been quite a journey to figure out who I am. On my birth cert, my name is Sarah Ann Ryan. I read Anne of Green Gables as a kid and began insisting on the E at the end of Ann &amp;#8211; why wouldn&amp;#8217;t you? My secondary school operated through the medium of the Irish language and insisted I use the full translation of both of my names &amp;#8211; Sorcha NÃ­ Riain.</description>

      <title>Weltschmertz from an atheist</title>

      <description>Some days I wish I believed in God. After hearing of the events in Connecticut today, this is one of those days. Today, faith would give me both someone to rail against, and would give me solace and comfort in the thought that those murdered had eternal souls, or a chance at rebirth.
Instead, Iâ€™m confronted with the bleak reality that a human person was either born or became so damaged that they could murder their family, along with innocent children and adults.</description>

      <description>For the last week, I&amp;#8217;ve been equally upset and outraged by the case of Savita Halappanavar, who died in Galway on October 28th after contracting septicaemia following a drawn-out miscarriage. The medical team waited until the foetal heart stopped beating before removing the foetus, even though risk of infection was extremely high. I&amp;#8217;ve contacted my local TDs (only one had the decency to respond so far) and stood outside the DÃ¡il with crowds of people twice.</description>
