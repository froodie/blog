      <description>What Iâ€™ve learned about dealing with Insomnia &amp;amp; Anxiety. A terrible twosome, these two conditions can go hand in hand, often with Depression rounding out the trifecta. It could beÂ finding it hard to go to sleep because of racing thoughts and elevated heartbeat or just lying awake in the middle the night worrying about everything that has happened, might happen or should have happened. And of course thereâ€™s the anxiety of â€œI should be asleep, Iâ€™m not asleep and NOW I AM ANXIOUS.</description>

      <description>This is the second post in my series on the topic of the different treatments I&amp;#8217;ve been on for Depression &amp;amp; Anxiety. I&amp;#8217;m looking at the different types of drugs I was prescribed and I might also tell you how I really feel about people&amp;#8217;s attitude to medicating for depression.
Before I say anything else, a disclaimer. These are the drugs I was prescribed, these are the effects and side-effects I personally had.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m planning a blog series. This has never ended well before now, but Iâ€™m going to try again anyway.
So this is the introductory post toâ€¦.. Drumroll
Adventures in Therapy! Iâ€™m planning to outline the different therapies Iâ€™ve availed of &amp;#8211; both medical and non-medical and what has worked for me. And probably also get angry at people who have internalised the stigma even though I should feel sorry for them ðŸ™‚</description>

      <description>Today is Time to Talk Day in Ireland, organised by the Green Ribbon Project
Weâ€™re making great strides in encouraging people with mental health difficulties, people who are struggling and people who are overwhelmed to reach out to someone and break the silence. From personal experience both as the reacher and the reachee, I wanted to share some tips on how to be reached out to.
The first step is Time It can be difficult to open up to someone and this is doubly true if itâ€™s the first time.</description>

      <description>You know those montages in silly Hollywood movies where one character lets themselves go completely and sits around watching daytime tv and eating cereal and wearing pyjamas/tracksuits all day with messy hair and an ever-expanding waistline? That&amp;#8217;s me. For the past four and a half months, since my contract wasn&amp;#8217;t renewed at the place were I worked and loved it, I&amp;#8217;ve been a Hollywood stereotype. And yes, I&amp;#8217;m listening to Rachmaninov&amp;#8217;s second piano concerto at the moment too.</description>
