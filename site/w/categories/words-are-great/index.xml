      <description>I saw this poem today, made the day a little brighter!
 Ah, Juliet, tis the sun!  Never thought we&amp;#8217;d see another one.  We feigned our death this day.  We fooled them all  And ran away.  Harvey R Wasserman </description>

      <description>To qualify this, I find poo amusing.
thefanboy{.lj-user} and the BoyBandSuperhero came up with this one
last night while celebrating their many successes of the day by standing
around in Indigo. They were teasing me about my lovelife.
&amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s fallen for you, you know. Fallen like a Poo into the Toilet Bowl
of Love.&amp;#8221;
I think it&amp;#8217;s funny anyway</description>
