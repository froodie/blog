      <description>This is the reason I’m voting YES with all of my heart. I’m doing it for my friends.
Dear straight friends,
I have friends who have been beaten up, friends who don’t hold hands in public, friends who have only come out to their families in order to ask them to vote yes in the referendum, friends whose families or parts of their families haven’t spoken to them in years because of their sexuality.</description>

      <description>Weddings &amp;#8211; they&amp;#8217;re definitely not like they used to be! In some ways, that&amp;#8217;s good. In others, maybe not so much. When it comes to spending a chunk of cash that could be better spent on a house or a car or a really expensive couch, I think things are maybe a little more frenzied than they used to be. The trend towards designing the day to be something that suits the couple getting wed can only be a good thing in my mind.</description>
