      <description>I stood up to a street harasser yesterday and I&amp;#8217;m glad I did. Here&amp;#8217;s a fuller version of the story.
First, some context:
A train full of people returning from a sporting event is an experience. I got the train from Limerick to Dublin yesterday and the first leg was full of Cork and Limerick supporters on their way home. I was on the train 15 minutes before departure and there were only a few empty seats dotted around the carriages.</description>

      <description>This awesome mooncup plushie is by Unicorn Reality This post is aimed at people who menstruate. It may be interesting to those who don&amp;#8217;t, but if you complain about it being about menstruation having read it, I&amp;#8217;m going to mock you.
 I&amp;#8217;ve been hearing about the next great leap in feminine hygiene (now there&amp;#8217;s a phrase I hate with a passion) for quite a few years now. The silicone menstrual cup goes by many names, almost all of them with a touch of the earthmother off them.</description>

      <description>For the last week, I&amp;#8217;ve been equally upset and outraged by the case of Savita Halappanavar, who died in Galway on October 28th after contracting septicaemia following a drawn-out miscarriage. The medical team waited until the foetal heart stopped beating before removing the foetus, even though risk of infection was extremely high. I&amp;#8217;ve contacted my local TDs (only one had the decency to respond so far) and stood outside the DÃ¡il with crowds of people twice.</description>
