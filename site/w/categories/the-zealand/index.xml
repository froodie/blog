      <description>It wasn&amp;#8217;t really coffee, but I actually liked the taste of it&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;ve had a couple of mugs of the most instant-est, muckest, lowest-grade Nescafé instant coffee today and it tastes and smells exactly like&amp;nbsp;this:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot about New Zealand since I came to Dublin. Memories keep bobbing to the surface of my mind when I least expect them to. I&amp;#8217;m dreaming about situations that did or could have taken place, following conversations to what could have been their conclusion, closing my eyes and seeing myself sitting on the verandah of the hostel in Okarito as the sun went down, drinking hot chocolate in Katipo, going to McDonalds in Auckland in the middle of the night with Legoboy, running away from some boy I&amp;#8217;d kissed on Stewart Island to go looking at the clearest sky and the brightest stars I&amp;#8217;d ever seen, trying to fly my kite the park in Christchurch and eventually succeeding.</description>

      <description>To qualify this, I find poo amusing.
thefanboy{.lj-user} and the BoyBandSuperhero came up with this one
last night while celebrating their many successes of the day by standing
around in Indigo. They were teasing me about my lovelife.
&amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s fallen for you, you know. Fallen like a Poo into the Toilet Bowl
of Love.&amp;#8221;
I think it&amp;#8217;s funny anyway</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s news: I like $100 more than I like rugby. There was a ticket for the taking, and I didn&amp;#8217;t take it. This marks me out as a rugby wuss. Which is ok by me. I was only in it for the chance to wear my Munster jersey and get shouted at by cork people anyway.
Yesterevening began my plan to impose on all of the people who drunkenly invited me over to their houses to watch movies and/or Invader Zim (and promptly forgot!</description>

      <description>I will never be straightedge.
Hooray for going to random parties with a bottle of cider.
Hooray for slint-core australian bands.
Hooray for creating folk-song-singing monsters and flame-throwing monsters merely through conversation.
Hooray for all the kids I ever met in Auckland being at this party.
Hooray for sending texts to yourself because it&amp;#8217;s free.
Slightly less hooray for wigging out a little and walking home.
And then HOORAY again for legoboy rescuing me and then going for burgers and crashing out in his room watching family guy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sitting in the only pub on the island, abusing the free internet and staring out of the window at the gorgeousness. This place rocks, it&amp;#8217;s so quiet and away from everything. I&amp;#8217;ve been here since thursday, and I&amp;#8217;m actually sad to be leaving tomorrow.
I haven&amp;#8217;t done much in the way of tramping or walking, but I have realised the extreme need I have of a pair of halfway decent hiking boots, as I&amp;#8217;m just starting to get into going for nice long walks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m only grumpy because I&amp;#8217;m exhausted. Didn&amp;#8217;t sleep well the night before last, had a LONG day yesterday and didn&amp;#8217;t sleep well last night either! Stupid city-centre hostels opposite the busiest street and the loudest pub in the town&amp;#8230; oh and having to &amp;#8216;sleep&amp;#8217; with the window open due to having a full dorm. (SCOWL)
At the YHA in Invercargill, waiting around for my flight to Stewart Island. I&amp;#8217;ve decided to go mental and spend three days over there, it will be all good, I&amp;#8217;m hoping.</description>

      <description>Talk about birdwatching!! I just had the most fantastic day out the Otago Peninsula&amp;#8230; We saw oystercatchers, paradise shell ducks, shags, herons, a kingfisher, LOADS of albatross, lil blue penguins and yellow-eyed penguins (hoiho). Also many fur seals. The Albatross is the most amazing bird. Its chest isn&amp;#8217;t strong enough to flap its wings very much, and yet it can fly 150,000 kilometres in a YEAR! It&amp;#8217;s so graceful and dignified and amazing to watch.</description>

      <description>Many things give me joy:
I found a bookcrossing book! My first one ever! It&amp;#8217;s Bee Season by Myla Goldberg, and I&amp;#8217;m just about to release Riddley Walker into the wild. Or rather, into a phone box! It&amp;#8217;s the best plan ever. And the karma feels great!
It&amp;#8217;s SUNNY
I&amp;#8217;m going to check out penguins in an hour&amp;#8230; well, less than an hour&amp;#8230; and I haven&amp;#8217;t packed yet, even though I&amp;#8217;m leaving tomorrow morning at a rediculous time of the day&amp;#8230; er&amp;#8230; yes.</description>

      <description>There were festivities last night. And I was getting really disheartened by the Dunedin nightlife (drunken students, crap charty hip-hop, techno in an old church and rednecks dancing on pooltables &amp;#8211; not all in the same place evidently). But then I found Bath Street and ah, it was good. I always said I like places with no dress code, no cover charge, good music and comfortable decor (even better if it&amp;#8217;s dark and you can spit on the floor).</description>

      <description>Charlotte and I were just wandering around town, checking out secondhand bookshops and having coffee and being exhausted and stuff, and then BAM, the octagon is filled with HORDES of bagpipers. there&amp;#8217;s some kind of competition on today I think.
THe best bit was at the end where about eight bands lined up together and all marched down George St playing Scotland the Brave. Stirring indeed. No matter who you are or where you&amp;#8217;re from, a bazillion bagpipers going right past your ear is an unforgettable experience.</description>

      <description>Today Dunedin is rain and bagpipes and soggy trouser legs and no breakfast yet, and talking to my mum and dad for ages on the phone for the first time in what seems like a million years! It was unbelieveably good to talk to them and they let me witter on for ages and actually gave me the gossip from home, which was cool. Now I&amp;#8217;m definitely in the mood for fried eggs for breakfast&amp;#8230; to the shop with me, for Greasy Breakfast Action&amp;#8230; Booyah!</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t quite seem to get a handle on Dunedin. I&amp;#8217;m not sure why, but it sort of eludes me. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because most of the students aren&amp;#8217;t here, and there are usually around 25,000 of them? I&amp;#8217;m not sure, but I think I could possibly like this town, once I get the hang of it.
Granted, it took me a lot longer than four days to get the hang of Auckland, but this place is so much smaller.</description>

      <description>I completely forgot about the pancakes yesterday, but last night at midnight there were the coolest fireworks to celebrate Chinese New Year. It&amp;#8217;s good that NZ sometimes remembers that it&amp;#8217;s closer to Asia than Europe. Also yesterday I wandered around the Museum, which was partially closed due to flooding from the excellent rains the day before. As were quite a few shops in the city centre.
I would say more, but I&amp;#8217;m sure you don&amp;#8217;t care that it was a little bit chilly last night, that I had tuna and cheese on toast for dinner or that I did my laundry and watched survivor.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was moderately uneventful, except that when I left the internet cafe there was a massive black cloud obscuring all light, and I eventually got caught in the mother of all downpours. It was great. Thunder, lightening, massive raindrops and rivers instead of streets! I got back to the hostel and was so soaking wet that I put my bag down and ran straight back out again.
Fantastic!
Today I got offered a lift to invercargill with two swiss chicks.</description>

      <description>Good afternoon,
Yesterday I arrived in Dunedin, proceeded to get lost, (which is never a good idea with a backpack that&amp;#8217;s too heavy), get found, went online to check my mail and update here, couldn&amp;#8217;t check my mail cos none of the websites would open, managed to open LJ and typed up a major updatey post on getting drunk and misbehaving, leaving christchurch, lake tekapo and the unbelievable gorgeousness, oamaru and limestone and small-town-ness and penguins and tour buses, and weird nightmares about fountains and collapsing buildings, and tried to post it and it died, which was the computer&amp;#8217;s fault, not mine&amp;#8230; and i had to pay $4 for the privilege of NOT BEING ABLE TO CHECK MY MAIL and GETTING UPSET THAT MY UPDATE GOT EATEN.</description>

      <description>Today was one of those days where I didn&amp;#8217;t get up til 11. pm.
Didn&amp;#8217;t really want to move. Didn&amp;#8217;t want to not-move. So I stayed there.
And I got a text asking me if i was ok or just hibernating. guyfullerton{.lj-user}, I love ya! 😀
Feeling a bit queasy now due to staying in bed all day, but not so bad, much better than I was earlier. The plan is to sleep tonight (if that happens it&amp;#8217;ll be fucking amazing) and have a talk to mel tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Today was just such a one.
Waking up early but not too early. Luxuriating in bed for just a little bit. Having a shower, a proper shower with gushing jets of not too hot, not too cold water. Strolling to the French Bakehouse for breakfast and up to Captain Ron&amp;#8217;s for coffee. Making a new friend or two. Deciding to go for a stroll Just Like That. Finding out how much it costs to rent an MX5 for a day and pretend to be Austin Powers(not that much really).</description>

      <description>I have spent by far the greater part of today in bed. It was my hostel&amp;#8217;s staff party last night&amp;#8230; lots of good Japanese food, sake, beer, champagne, shots and beer. And me being very drunk. Who is the boy with the green hat? I don&amp;#8217;t know, but I had lots of fun all the same. Danced and flirted and tried to pick up boys and girls, and eventually succeeded in finding a boy who wanted to kiss me.</description>

      <description>It was a hard-out hardcore weekend. Mostly for others, not really for me. I went for a couple of drinks on friday after work with the boys and the girls from GE, on account of it being my last day and of them all being great. One drink became more than that, and, well, I became drunk. Tequila shots and professing my (unfelt) adoration for my mate&amp;#8217;s flatmate were some of the things that I recall, along with spilling an entire bottle of beer on myself.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;  In other news. I got smacked in the face by a prawn.
While eating at a Japanese restaurant last night to celebrate Bula Bula&amp;#8217;s Forty-Somethingth birthday, one of the entertaining chefs flipped a prawn and it smacked me wetly right between the eyes. Lucky me!  Also I took the day off work. I wasn&amp;#8217;t drinking, was home by 10 and in bed relatively early, but felt like shit this morning, leaden, sickly, headachy and miserable.</description>

      <description>This morning I decided to take a sickie from work because I was tired and not feeling the best. So I called in sick, changed my doctor&amp;#8217;s appointment to today and crawled back to bed. Whereupon the phone rang. It was my dad, telling me that my grandfather had died. I still don&amp;#8217;t know when exactly. And I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure of the details except that he was out on the farm, picking apples on a lovely November day.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s funny to think that it&amp;#8217;s November-y back home. Here it&amp;#8217;s summer holiday weather. We sat outside O&amp;#8217;Carrolls, an Irish bar, for a few hours this evening, in t-shirts or string tops, and jandals. Myself, Caroline, Liz and Gary and Phil decided to bring lots of randoms along to the pub with us. So we were joined by what turned out to be 5 Hot Guys.

      <description>Buggerit! I really am working for the man. GE donated $2.58million to the US Republican party since 1999. Yuk. I&amp;#8217;m finishing in 2 weeks though, so that&amp;#8217;ll stick it to them. Yeah! And I stole about 20 helium balloons today, all printed with GE Money, which is what GE finance is now called in New Zealand. So I&amp;#8217;ve made them scared now, I&amp;#8217;ll bet.
In other news, there has been much fun and also some sleep had.</description>

      <description>Since the last time I did the blogging thing, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing more or less the same things, talking to the same people, working the same jobs, complaining about the same things. Three jobs is too many. Therefore from the 31st, I shall be a woman with a mere TWO jobs. the daytime one and the sometimes cleaning one are all that will be left to me. With the free time I get as a prize for removing a chunk of my income I plan to do things, write things, keep in contact with people, get some exercise and fresh air, go places, read more, meet more people and have more fun.</description>

      <description>Well, I&amp;#8217;m here. And I like Auckland, so I think I&amp;#8217;ll stay a while. Need to find a job, and update my CV and open a bank account and AAGH. I&amp;#8217;ve been online for an hour an a half already, looking for somewhere to live, but it&amp;#8217;s hard when ya have no money. I might just live in a backpacker hostel for a while.</description>

      <description>My fixation with possessions will come to an end pretty quickly once I have to carry them all on my back. Who&amp;#8217;da thunk that a few changes of clothes and a toothbrush would weigh so much? Well, slightly more than that, perhaps. I wish I could bring a laptop (but I don&amp;#8217;t have one), a ballgown (just in case, even though I hate balls), a guitar (so that I could learn how to play it and do some busking) and the new set of kitchen knives my mum bought last week because I made her.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve just finished a sort of half-assed tidying of my house. There were maybe fifty people here earlier. Practically everyone who was invited turned up. There were mounds of food and fathoms of drink and it actually seemed like everyone was having a good time. There was music and singing and small children playing with dogs or colouring-in quietly, and nonchalant boys playing frisbee on the grass, and girleens playing the fine art of camogie, and drunken next-door neighbours playing Jenga, and ickle babies, and newly engaged couples, and old ladies with great stories about french exchanges with sons of Comptesses.</description>
